  <thing id="thAlchemis" name="Alchemist" description="Masters of a rare and ancient discipline, alchemists study the properties of mundane and magical elements. They are keen observers of the physical world, and many alchemists have extensive interests in fields of knowledge ranging from astronomy to zoology.\n    Although many wizards find the study of alchemy rewarding, not all alchemists are wizards. Alchemy does not require the casting of spells or the use of arcane power; the reagents provide all the magic that is necessary to create alchemical effects. Anybody who has a reliable formula, the necessary ingredients, and the specialized knowledge to follow exacting instructions precisely can create alchemical substances and devices. For example, fighters and paladins sometimes study alchemy for its usefulness in siegecraft and military engineering, and rogues find many uses for smoke bombs, lock-eating acids, and sleeping powders.\n    Experiment and experience are the alchemist&#146;s path to understanding, and the vast majority of alchemists maintain a large laboratory stocked with a huge variety of tools and reagents. Alchemical laboratories are expensive, so most alchemists seek out a wealthy sponsor, such as a royal patron, or a civic commission. In some lands, sponsorship of a famous alchemist is a point of great pride, and rival cities or courts seek to entice alchemists of renown to establish workshops in the realm. Alchemists who have no royal patrons support their studies and experiments by producing mixtures that are useful to other artisans, or substances that have military (or criminal) applications. Unsponsored alchemists have less time or fewer resources available for pure experimentation, but they&#146;re also not hampered by meddling or inconvenient requests from the lord or lady holding the purse strings.\n\n{b}Alchemist Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the Alchemist feat as a bonus feat. You know the formula for a particular 1st-level alchemical item (such as alchemist&#146;s fire). You can use this formula without needing training in any skill associated with it.\n    At the end of a short rest, you can create one alchemical item of your level or lower at no cost. You must know the formula for the item you create.

  <thing id="thmAnimMst" name="Animal Master" description="Gifted with an uncanny ability to befriend and train natural beasts, animal masters are often more at home with animals than with people. Anyone who lacks for humanoid companionship might adopt an animal as a friend and traveling companion, but animal masters aren&#146;t just collectors of pets&#151;they&#146;re expert trainers and handlers who establish practical partnerships with their animal companions. Animals possess crucial senses and abilities that humans (and other civilized people) lack, and by working closely with a well-trained partner, animal masters gain the benefit of these senses and talents too.\n    Although some who work with animals train large, ferocious creatures as battle companions, most animal masters work with common animals that are easily domesticated. Their companions are friendly toward or tolerate humans, and they have much more ability to learn complicated tricks and behaviors than truly wild animals do. Heroes interested in keeping panthers, bears, wolves, or other large carnivores to tear their foes to pieces belong in the druid or ranger classes, where they can learn the appropriate powers and acquire dangerous wild beasts to aid them in battle.\n    Animal Minions in Combat\nYour animal minion normally stays out of the way in combat, waiting by the outskirts of the fighting. You can direct it to help you by using distracting attack. If you&#146;re not using your animal minion to harass a foe, you can assume that your pet is safely out of harm&#146;s way and won&#146;t attract any enemy attention. Distracting attack doesn&#146;t normally provoke a response against your animal, since it moves in and out of the thick of the fighting quickly.\n    At the DM&#146;s discretion, an animal minion can act independently; for example, if you are incapacitated, your minion might run off to bring help back to you.\n    Replacing Animal Minions\nUntil you reach 5th level, if your animal minion is killed, you can replace it after the end of your current adventure or one week, whichever comes first.\n\n   {b} Animal Master Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} Choose one of the five animals described below&#151;cat, dog, hawk, monkey, or raven&#151;to be your animal minion. This creature accompanies you for as long as it lives. The animal doesn&apos;t have a normal complement of actions, but it can take a move action when you take one. If it has a power, it can use it only on your turn. (With your DM&#146;s consent, you can substitute any similar creature for these choices; for example, an otter would be much like a cat with a skill bonus for swimming instead of climbing and jumping, and a badger is pretty close to a small dog in size and abilities.)\n    In addition, you gain the distracting attack power.\n    {b}Animal Master Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You can find and train a new animal minion at the end of any extended rest. If no suitable creatures are in your vicinity, you have to wait until you find a better spot. You can have only one animal minion at a time.\n    {b}Animal Master Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff checks, Diplomacy checks, Insight checks, and Intimidate checks made against natural beasts." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thBeglr" name="Beguiler" description="Beguilers aspire to become masters of deception in all its forms. Consummate practical jokers, they delight in playing tricks even on their closest friends. A beguiler might be a master spy, able to slip into the shadows of an alley to evade a bothersome patrol, or a glib-tongued charmer who cons a wealthy merchant out of priceless jewels. Unattended valuables have a way of mysteriously disappearing in a beguiler&#146;s presence; those that are carefully watched are simply more of a challenge.\n    Beguilers struggle to tell the truth at the best of times. The stories they recount feature outlandish embellishments: The small drake vanquished by the beguiler&#146;s adventuring party is likely to become a massive red dragon somewhere around the third retelling. Succeeding with one lie just encourages the beguiler to try another, more outrageous one.\n    The greater the level of skill required to pull off a deception, the more likely a beguiler is to attempt it, just to see what he or she can get away with. Should a patron challenge one to pull off a difficult heist, or to deceive an entire town with a near-impossible illusion, the beguiler will pursue the assignment obsessively, to the exclusion of all else.\n    Beguilers often find employment as spies or thieves. Most possess a smattering of skills useful to such occupations: the crafting of disguises, the ability to disarm traps and pick troublesome locks, and the training to tread quietly without drawing attention. Able to think quickly on their feet, beguilers can lie readily and convincingly should they be discovered in an indelicate situation. Unlike most traditional spies, however, many beguilers also possess a strong affinity for mind-altering magic (including bards, or wizards specializing in illusion or enchantment) or a strong connection to the Shadowfell (such as assassins and nethermancers). Whether conjuring an illusory wall of fog to secure their escape, or implanting a simple magical suggestion in a guard, beguilers frequently use arcane trickery to succeed in their goals.\n    Most covert operators aim to get away clean and finish the task with none the wiser. Beguilers, however, take great pride in their grandiose deceptions and want the world to know what they have accomplished&#151;not just that they succeeded, but how they did it. Thus, a beguiler might leave a calling card after stealing an enchanted sword from a supposedly impregnable vault, or imprint a unique signature on a masterful illusion, such as a fake volcanic eruption that evacuates a nearby town.\n    Beguilers place great importance on their reputations, and many acquire followers who admire their exploits. They delight in building an entourage that hangs on their every word. As they rise in stature, beguilers seek to acquire apprentices from the ranks of amateur thieves and illusionists drawn to their growing legend&#151;though such a master never reveals all his or her secrets. Ironically for those so adept at deceiving others, beguilers are often vulnerable to flattery from sycophantic devotees.\n\n    {b}Beguiler Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain proficiency with orbs.\n    In addition, you gain the beguiling flash power.\n    {b}Beguiler Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks and Stealth checks.\n    {b}Beguiler Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} If you miss an enemy with an arcane attack power while you have any concealment from that enemy, you gain a +2 power bonus to the next attack roll you make against it before the end of your next turn." compset="Theme">

You must be able to prepare spells from a spellbook (such as with the Arcanist&#146;s Spellbook, Bladesinger&#146;s Spellbook, or Mage&#146;s Spellbook class feature).\n\nYou always wanted to be a wizard. Your family did its best to indulge your dream, even when others told you that you would never amount to anything. You attended public academies and auditioned with private spellcasters, striving without success to master the techniques of an apprentice mage. Enchantment, evocation, illusion&#151;every school of magic was a closed door to you. The simplest cantrips seemed to be out of your reach. You would have given up, but you were convinced that it was a matter of learning, not a matter of talent. If only you could find the right teacher.\n    Having exhausted all other options, you presented yourself at the fabled Blackstaff Tower. The new archmage of Waterdeep and the master of Blackstaff Tower, Vajra Safhar, had issued an open call in search of apprentices. To your surprise, and that of Waterdeep&#146;s magical community, you were among those whom Vajra chose to train as one of her new corps of Blackstaff wizards.\n    With your fellow apprentices, you embarked on an experimental path of study that demanded absolute understanding and mastery of magic&#146;s fundamentals before specializing in any one school. Under Vajra&#146;s unorthodox tutelage, you flourished. Then, on the eve of your first-year exam, Vajra vanished.\n    For weeks, you and the other apprentices waited, without a hint or an indication of your mentor&#146;s fate. Finally, with a heavy heart and a backpack full of books, you set out from Blackstaff Tower. You resolve to continue your studies, even as you search for Vajra&#146;s whereabouts. You&#146;re so close to being a wizard, it&#146;d be ludicrous to stop now.\n\n    {b}Blackstaff Apprentice Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the magic missile power if you do not already have it.

  <thing id="thBrznAmbs" name="Brazen Ambassador" description="The City of Brass in the Elemental Chaos is a complex net of social intrigue, woven through the courts of the efreet lords who stand as the city&#146;s masters. The feuds, alliances, and enmities of the city require a special class of citizen to navigate: the brazen ambassadors. Developed as a means for embattled efreets to communicate with their peers, brazen ambassadors have taken on a greater role, not just within the City of Brass but also on far-flung planes. Today, brazen ambassadors handle most of a lord&#146;s affairs, from negotiating alliances with the city&#146;s many courts to brokering with planar traders that come to the city. They even deign to represent Bashamgurda, Lord of the Efreets, and through him, the City of Brass itself.\n    Each brazen ambassador is drawn from the ranks of slaves within the City of Brass, and the decision to elevate such an individual is not made lightly. The process requires potent magic, demanding the investment of an efreet patron&#146;s power. The efreet first draws off some of its burning blood, which a specially trained ritual practitioner, or sahaar, uses to tattoo arcane symbols on the skin of the chosen figure. As it cools, the blood leaves a brass filigree etched into the ambassador&#146;s skin. This initiation is dangerous; the frail do not survive. Adventurers are prized choices to become brazen ambassadors because they are far more likely to survive the process than any common slaveling.\n    The markings on an ambassador serve two purposes. The first and most obvious is to distinguish a brazen ambassador as more than a mere slave. At a glance, an efreet can know that the words of such an individual are not the mere whining of a lowly slave&#151; they are treated as the words of a peer. Second, the ritual causes the blood of the patron to intermingle with that of its ambassador, causing the ambassador to become a part of that efreet&#146;s bloodline. The connection between an ambassador and its patron is a potent one, permitting the efreet to invest an ambassador with some of its power, even across the planes.\n\n{b}Brazen Ambassador Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the bound by brass power.\n{b}Brazen Ambassador Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} Once per encounter, when you roll a Bluff check against a creature of the elemental origin and dislike the result, you can reroll the check.

As if directed by psychic command, your companions suddenly turned against you as one. Drow are treacherous by nature, but such a blatant and brutal attack could mean only one thing: Your house had fallen. You escaped with your life, but with no allies and no idea of what to do next.\n    None survive alone in the wilds of the Underdark for long, and so your would-be killers assumed you to be dead&#151;as you would have been if the members of Bregan D&#146;aerthe had not found you. You had heard the tales of these drow mercenaries, of course&#151;the much-derided and dishonorable castaways of other destroyed houses. When your benefactors confirmed that your kin had been annihilated, you expected them to show contempt for the weakness of your house and your own helplessness. Instead, they offered to induct you into their company&#151;giving you a chance to restore the honor, the allies, and the home that had been taken from you.\n    For decades, you have served as part of Bregan D&#146;aerthe. As a part of the force sent to the surface to manipulate events in Luskan, you have watched that city&#146;s steady decline from den of piracy to cesspool of evil. You felt the tremors in the earth and saw the plume of black smoke to the south that marked Neverwinter&#146;s fall. During this time, Bregan D&#146;aerthe continued to add to its coffers with missions for hire, but the opportunities for wealth grew slimmer as the danger in the North spread.\n    Now, the mercenary drow have largely left the region, with only a few such as you remaining. You would have preferred to go with your fellows, but an order from Jarlaxle brought you instead to the ruins of Neverwinter. The sometime leader of Bregan D&#146;aerthe gave you the task of investigating the forces at work in the city and the surrounding area&#151;and, as always, to look for ways for Bregan D&#146;aerthe to profit from others&#146; plots. You have been told that someone&#151;perhaps Jarlaxle himself&#151;will come to you for information. Until then, you are on your own.\n    You have learned that it doesn&#146;t pay to be without allies&#151;even in the relative safety of the surface world. Few surface-dwellers have any compunctions about the death of a lone drow, particularly in the lawless North. Like Jarlaxle and the legendary Drizzt, you need to travel with others if you are to be successful in your goals.\n\n{b}Bregan D&apos;aerthe Spy Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the levitation power.\n{b}Bregan D&apos;aerthe Spy Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain the continuous levitation power.\n{b}Bregan D&apos;aerthe Spy Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} When you grant combat advantage, enemies do not gain the bonus to attack rolls against you." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thCalDrg" name="Callidyrr Dragoon" description="{i}Duty bids me to defend the realm of my ancestors. Honor demands that I act with temperance before valor. For the glory of the High King, this I swear.{/i}\n\nCallidyrr stands as a beacon of hope in a region overrun with malevolent fey, marauding giants, and bloodthirsty lycanthropes. As a Callidyrr dragoon, you are a stalwart defender of the realm, a privileged member of the High King&#146;s elite guard. Dragoon is a special title awarded to individuals who have shown exceptional service to the crown.\n    Unlike knights of the realm, dragoons do not muster with the realm&#146;s army but instead receive assignments best handled alongside a small number of compatriots. As such, Callidyrr dragoons receive specialized training in diplomacy and espionage. Dragoons have access to the Palace of the High King and can speak with royal authority throughout the realm. In exchange for these privileges, a dragoon must swear a binding oath of unwavering allegiance to the High King and the land. The Royal Hierophant administers this oath and seals it with a geas that binds the dragoon to the honored ancestors. If the dragoon ever forsakes the vows to king and country, the geas irrevocably wipes the fallen dragoon of his memories.\n    The rank of dragoon is relatively new, having been born of the nation&#146;s conflict with Amn at the dawn of the century. After repeated failed attempts to forcibly liberate the kingdom of Westphal from Amnian occupation, High Queen Alicia Kendrick founded the dragoons to work against the Amnian invaders clandestinely.\n    When the High Queen died unexpectedly in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted (1407 DR), the dragoons were instrumental in quelling insurgent uprisings throughout Callidyrr. Common belief held that agents of Lionel Carrathal, heir to the former royal dynasty of Callidyrr who claimed to be the &#147;true&#148; High King of the Moonshaes, poisoned the beloved High Queen.\n    In the years since, the dragoons have thwarted countless assassins, driven off sahuagin incursions, and even brokered a tenuous peace with the fey of Sarifal. This proud legacy is what you inherit as a Callidyrr dragoon. May you live up to its valorous ideal.\n\n{b}Callidyrr Dragoon Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the Mounted Combat feat. In addition, you gain proficiency with one military melee weapon of your choice.\n{b}Callidyrr Dragoon Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks.\n{b}Callidyrr Dragoon Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You can use the Diplomacy skill as if it were the Heal skill to grant either a saving throw or a use of second wind.

  <thing id="thChaosMd" name="Chaosmade" description="Throughout the mortal world and scattered among the planes, hidden pockets of the Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye work in secret to avoid persecution from those who do not understand their faith. The cult is a fragmented organization. Few members fully understand the forces they worship, but all have a common goal: to blur the lines between the mortal world and the Elemental Chaos. The various sects have different understandings of what will happen when they achieve that goal, but they all pursue it with equal fervor.\n    One of the more unusual methods used by the cults to hasten the planar merging is the creation of the creatures known as chaosmade. Strange hybrids of mortal races and the Elemental Chaos itself, the chaosmade are living, breathing hosts of the disquieting forces of the plane. Wherever chaosmade walk, order is doomed to fall into disorder, and, little by little, the Elemental Chaos leaks into the world.\n    The creation of a chaosmade is an exercise in potent magic, done in secret. The cult continually watches the offspring of its members to see if any bear the marks of chaos. These marks manifest in many ways, from an unusual birthmark, to a hatred for tradition, to an unrestrained spirit. These criteria change from one cult to another, but the outcome is the same. The cult takes the child to its inner sanctum, where it is reborn as a chaosmade.\n    The high priest strips a portion of the child&#146;s soul away and plants in its place a seed of pure chaos, which in time will grow and flourish. This force feeds on the whims and urges of the individual, and in turn, it shapes those urges toward fomenting discord. In return, a chaosmade has access to immense power that, while it can be directed, is torturously difficult to control.\n\n{b}Chaosmade Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} Your origin changes to elemental if it is not elemental already.

  <thing id="thChevalr" name="Chevalier" description="Dedicated to the ideals of chivalry, chevaliers are gallant warriors who serve as champions and exemplars to the people around them. A chevalier&#146;s personal honor is his or her most treasured possession; it is far better to die with honor than to live without it. Chivalric codes vary from race to race and culture to culture, but most agree on a number of noble virtues that all chevaliers should aspire to: courage, fairness, mercy, justice, loyalty, honesty, charity, piety, moderation, and gallantry.\n    Although chevaliers strive to cultivate all the chivalric virtues, the most important elements of their code revolve around behavior on the field of battle. Honor demands that chevaliers seek out the most worthy foes on the field to defeat in a fair fight. Chevaliers aren&#146;t under any requirement to stand and die against superior foes&#151;but they must stand as long as they hold out any hope for victory, and they need to execute a fighting retreat rather than flee in panic if the battle is hopeless. Likewise, chevaliers strive to fight fairly. Flanking foes or attacking dazed enemies is fair enough, especially if the enemy has the advantage of numbers, but performing a coup de grace or attacking a stunned foe is not honorable. Some chevaliers might wait for enemies that have fallen prone to stand again before resuming combat, or to permit a respite if a foe requests one. Of course, enemies who refuse to fight in a chivalrous manner fall outside the protections of honor and should be dealt with in the most expedient manner available.\n    Chevaliers frequently come from well-born families. Many chivalrous traditions arise from the requirements of elite military social classes, such as heavily armored cavalry and highly trained sword fighters. Acquiring the specialized equipment and years of training needed to serve as their realms&#146; most highly prized warriors&#151;whether that warrior ideal is a human knight, a dwarf giant-slayer, or an eladrin bladesinger&#151;is never cheap or easy. In some lands, aspiring heroes aren&#146;t permitted to become chevaliers unless they can prove their noble birth and thus their right to claim the privileges of knighthood, but in most places low-born warriors of skill and personal integrity can win their spurs through the sponsorship of royal patrons or their performance on the battlefield. No one denies that chevaliers are prone to more than a little haughtiness toward those they perceive as their social inferiors, but even the prickliest among them are conscious of their obligation to protect the weak and the poor from those who would oppress them.\n\n{b}Chevalier Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} While mounted, you and your mount gain a +5 power bonus to Athletics checks and Acrobatics checks to jump, swim, or hop down.

  <thing id="thCrmBMg" name="Cormyrian Battle Mage" description="Prerequisite: Unaligned, good, or lawful good wizard or sorcerer\n\nAlthough any magician can create fire or force effects to hinder foes, a battle mage studies the art of maximizing his or her devastating effectiveness under the watchful eye of an established War Wizard. Those who truly master the craft might be invited to join the order of Cormyr&#146;s War Wizards, the elite battle casters sworn to the crown of Cormyr.\n    The War Wizards of Cormyr are a secretive group. They realize that if the secrets they discover are shared only with those within their ranks, they gain an edge over their enemies. They reveal some of these secrets through research, and they find others in long-lost tomes of lore. Many War Wizards send their battle mage apprentices out with adventurers, with strict instructions to return and share any ancient secrets they might uncover. Like Purple Dragons, War Wizards and battle mages must swear an oath of fealty to Cormyr before training begins.\n    Most battle mages are recruited as children when they show aptitude after being introduced to arcane theories or if they exhibit a natural talent for the arcane art. Some students who excel at their studies after being recruited are tested by a War Wizard and, if special talent is identified, they are taken from their families to learn at the War Wizard Academy. Only a few of those who achieve the mastery of basic arcane practices are admitted to the academy formally and are assigned to a particular War Wizard as an apprentice. The others are returned to their families. Having one&#146;s child selected to study with the War Wizards is considered a great honor.\n    Once admitted, an apprentice spends five years studying the basic tenets of wizardry. Over half cannot achieve the high standards set by the War Wizards and are dismissed. After five years of successful study, an apprentice gains the benefits and official title of battle mage. He or she then studies additional secrets unique to the War Wizards.\n    A few adults petition the War Wizards for an apprenticeship to learn their secrets and master their craft. The War Wizards are suspicious of such requests and turn away those who have not gained the full trust of the crown or proven themselves loyal citizens. Petitioners must undergo a series of divinations and other tests to verify their intentions. They must also prove their value to the organization by providing new knowledge of the arcane arts or by teaching a new and useful spell. Only then can a practicing wizard or sorcerer become the apprentice of a War Wizard. The expectations for all battle mages are the same, regardless of age.\n    After becoming a battle mage, some thus titled request a sabbatical to travel the world so that they can learn mystical secrets to bring back to the organization and strengthen it.\n\n    Cormyrian Battle Mage Starting Feature (1st level): You gain the defensive casting power.\n    Cormyrian Battle Mage Level 5 Feature (5th level): You gain a +2 power bonus to History checks and Religion checks.\n    Cormyrian Battle Mage Level 10 Feature (10th level): You cannot be surprised." compset="Theme">

After all, cults honor a higher power, a greater good, or a treasured ideal.\n    What sets a cult apart from other religious institutions is a fundamentally bad belief, a perception about the cosmos that is diametrically opposed to those held by right-thinking folk. A cult&#146;s creed could be based on an extraordinary interpretation of a god (any god, even a good one) that compels certain sinister practices in their worship. Another cult might elevate a demon lord, monstrous alien, or dark power to divine status. Cults could be founded by devotees of beings that exist only in their minds. Such strange and deviant belief breeds dangerous behaviors and attracts the attention of forces that champion the good. As a result, most cults are driven underground.\n    Cults spring up regularly the world over. Fear, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction foment offbeat beliefs and unwholesome ideas about how the world works and what the future holds. Cult leaders prey on doubts and superstition, drawing the disaffected and the despairing under their inf luence. One by one, adherents are brought under the cult&#146;s sway, abandoning families and work to find the salvation promised by following the one true path.\n    Few cults subscribe to peace and harmony. Such rewards must be earned, a task that is impossible to realize in the present state of affairs. Therefore, cults are subversive societies, working against governments and widespread faiths, all to attain whatever objective the cult was founded to achieve.\n\n{b}Cultist Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the master&apos;s eye power.\n{b}Cultist Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} While you are bloodied, you gain a +1 power bonus to Fortitude and Will.\n{b}Cultist Level 10 Feature (10th level){/b}: You gain a +2 power bonus to Intimidate checks.\n    In addition, during the first round of each encounter, enemies take a -2 penalty to attack rolls against you." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thAthMins" name="Athasian Minstrel" description="{i}&quot;Set aside your cares for a time, my lords and ladies, and lend an ear to my song. Tomorrow is for toil and worry; tonight we make revel!&quot;{/i}\nThe minstrels of Athas are entertainers to the wealthy and powerful elite of the city-states. Singers, acrobats, poets, dancers, and storytellers, minstrels tour the cities of Athas in troupes or individually, making a living with their wits and talents. The civilized peoples of Athas have long celebrated minstrels, and by tradition all but the poorest or most suspicious of hosts are proud to open their doors to traveling performers. Hosting a minstrel or sponsoring a troupe&#146;s performance reflects well on the host, and most Athasians are eager to forget their troubles with a few hours of song and dance. Nobles often send troupes of minstrels to one another as gifts; it is seen as a great insult to refuse such a gift, even when all involved know that minstrels are often spies or assassins.\n    The most skilled (or fortunate) minstrels are highly paid companions to nobility, trusted advisors or agents who enjoy the most intimate confidences of their patrons. Minstrels are often retained by noble houses to tutor young nobles or teach them about the world. They might serve as bodyguards and fighting instructors at the same time. Minstrels who belong to a troupe lack the comfort and trust bestowed on a kept minstrel, but they enjoy the freedom to travel and the aid of a network of informants and allies throughout the Tyr Region. The poorest and most humble minstrels are simple wandering storytellers or jugglers who perform for their supper from night to night.\n    Many minstrels have a dark side they conceal beneath their charm and talent. Those with ambition and ruthlessness find opportunities in the employ of the elite classes. Minstrels often lead double lives as blackmailers, thieves, spies, or assassins; a minstrel&#146;s visit or a troupe&#146;s performance might conceal a mission of espionage or murder. They are renowned as masters of poison, concealed weapons, and subtle trickery. Even the humblest wandering minstrel with threadbare cloak and battered lyre might be more than he or she seems&#151;there&#146;s no better spy than someone who seems harmless and is welcome wherever he or she goes." compset="Theme">

I&#146;ve seen it all, and there isn&#146;t much left that can surprise me.&quot;{/i}\nDune traders roam every civilized corner of the known world. From crowded marketplaces crawling with thieves, to caravans wending across difficult wastes, to the isolated settlements and trading posts found in the places between the great city-states, dune traders are everywhere, pushing their wares on anyone they encounter. Dune traders bring needed goods to remote areas, offering water, food, arms, and more, but their work is not charity. Such offerings come at the highest prices a merchant can ask and still be able to move the merchandise. It&#146;s all about making a profit, and no one does a better job at looking out for themselves and their wealth than the dune traders of Athas.\n    Many small traders and merchant cabals exist, but they pale next to the dynastic houses that dominate trade across the Tyr Region. These houses are nations unto themselves, sworn to no sorcerer-king but allied with all. They field their own armies, hold their own lands, and take an active part in political and social developments affecting the region. A merchant house&#146;s leadership might rest in one family&#146;s hands, but these houses readily accept new members, always looking for new talent to bolster their presence and influence in the Tyr Region. Regardless of the position sought, candidates must swear several oaths to the house leaders. In exchange, a candidate receives protection, status, and regular pay. The particular oaths vary from house to house, but the following are common to them all.\n&#149; Forsake any citizenship or membership in a city-state or tribe.\n&#149; Swear allegiance to the merchant house.\n&#149; Always act in the merchant house&#146;s best interest.\n&#149; Deal honestly with stranger, friend, and foe.\n&#149; Flaunt no wealth gained through employment by the house.\n&#149; Uphold the local laws and always act in accordance with them.\n&#149; Protect your own, lending help to merchants in need and refusing to deal with those who unjustly imprison or harass any merchant.\n    In contrast to the great dynastic houses of the city-states, elven merchant tribes are small and mobile. They do not enjoy the peaceful relations enjoyed by the dynastic houses and, for this reason, they are not beholden to any oaths or promises. They foist off junk, deal in contraband, and sometimes resort to base robbery if given sufficient cause. Elven houses tend to be tribal in structure, but they are as widespread and as dangerous as any human organization." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thElePries" name="Elemental Priest" description="{i}&quot;I hold the wrath of fire in my grasp, the endurance of rock in my shoulders. None can outlast me in battle.&quot;{/i}\n\nThe gods of Athas are little more than half-remembered myths in the current age, but many of those who live beneath the crimson sun give their devotion and worship to other powers. Some worship sorcererkings who claim to be divine, or the false deities other sorcerer-kings purport to serve. Some worship demons or primordials&#151;grim, malevolent patrons that frequently demand terrible rites or horrendous acts of sacrifice. But most Athasians instead venerate the living elements as they manifest in the world.\n    Elemental priests are those who serve these sullen and fierce spirits. They have a special kinship with the primal elements, a connection so close it&#146;s as if they stand in two worlds: that of mortals, and that of raw elemental power. They channel this rage into themselves to call forth the spirits of rock and fire, wind and water, seeking their aid in battle.\n    Dozens of elemental cults and priesthoods exist in the Tyr Region. For the most part, these cults are impoverished, weak, and mocked by city dwellers. However, the people who dwell in the villages and wastes have a different opinion of elemental priests. They regard them as holders of powerful and dangerous magic, to be respected or feared accordingly.\n    Many elemental priests revere the nameless, formless principle of all living elements together, making no distinction between one manifestation over another. However, others give themselves to more specific examples of elemental power. For example, the Smoking Crown is home to dwarf priests who serve the spirit of the volcano, whereas the mountain known as An-Bezzumar, the Crown of Heaven, is sacred to goliath wind shamans. The wandering thrikreen mystics known as the Rainspeakers venerate the rare, blessed showers that fall a few times each year during the cooler months and often make pilgrimages to places where rain is soon to fall.\n    Heroic elemental priests are leaders of the village and wasteland folk and potent enemies of the sorcerer-kings and their templars. They are often intermediaries who protect villagers by seeking to placate angry elemental manifestations or summon vanished ones to places where they are needed. Some elemental priests instead follow a monastic or ascetic tradition instead of the more common tribal or village traditions of elemental worship. Your character might therefore be a secret scholar or cultist indoctrinated in a hidden temple, or a semibarbaric elemental priest raised among the people of the wastes." compset="Theme">

Only one of us will leave the arena this day, and it&#146;s going to be me.&quot;{/i}\n\nLife under the sorcerer-kings is hard. Water, food, and shelter are never guaranteed, and one misstep can result in a public flogging by an overambitious templar or a swift execution to serve as warning to others who might overstep their bounds. But the sorcerer-kings know that even with loyal templars and vast armies at their command, they rule with their subjects&#146; consent. To distract the masses from their misery, to divert public attention from oppressive laws and heavy taxes, the sorcerer-kings decree the incessant spectacle of gladiatorial games.\n    Each city-state boasts an impressive arena, with enough seating to hold most of its citizens. Each week, or more often depending on weather or political conditions, nobles and commoners gather to watch the drama unfold, cheering madly as their favorite warriors duel with other gladiators, work in teams to claim the contest&#146;s great prize, or fight en masse to defeat whatever new horror the arena masters have plucked, no doubt at great expense and loss of life, from the desert wastes.\n    Naturally, most gladiators are slaves. Chosen for this fate because of their strength or skill, they live and die at the crowd&#146;s favor, pitting what training they acquire against myriad foes, never knowing when they will face an insurmountable foe, never sure when their opponent will be their equal. Arena masters understand that their warriors fight with passion when they have something to fight for, and so they offer freedom, wealth, pleasure, or some other incentive to stoke the fires and keep their captive warriors eager for victory. Freedom is the greatest prize, of course&#151;but the games are so violent that few gladiators live long enough to earn the victories they need to escape.\n    The life of a gladiator is brutish and brief, but it is the one occupation a slave can hold that also brings respect. Gladiators are heroes to the common people. Their trials and victories are the stuff of legend, and many slaves grow comfortable from the accolades their conquests bring.\n\n{b}Gladiator Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the Disrupting Advance Power." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

No need to worry about political assassinations, no lessons to keep up with, no property to protect. All they need to do is survive.&quot;{/i}\n\nWithin the city-states, noble castes own more land and more slaves than anyone except the sorcererkings. The members of this social class are largely ineffectual puppets who have no real power, and only rarely do they muster the courage to oppose the plans of the sorcerer-kings. Even when they do so, it&#146;s not for the greater good. Most nobles watch out only for their own interests. They care nothing about what happens to people of lower castes, with the possible exception of people they own.\n    Though nobles lack true power, they gain many advantages due to their wealth. Nobles can read and write and can easily acquire food and water, which isn&#146;t true for much of the Athasian population. Every noble receives a basic education in psionics, either through a school or from a tutor hired by the noble&#146;s family, learning an array of psionic talents to better defend himself or herself against enemies or to command minions. Most lose interest in their training and fall into the same decadent malaise that pervades the noble caste. Only a rare few nobles fully develop their psionic talents, but those who do so are among the most capable and dangerous practitioners of the Way.\n\n{b}Noble Adept Power Point (1st level):{/b} You gain 1 power point.\n\nIf you choose a noble adept attack power of level 3 or 7 instead of a nonaugmentable encounter attack power at that level, you also gain 2 power points. If you do so with a power of level 13 or 17, you instead gain 4 power points, and if you do so with a power of level 23 or 27, you instead gain 6 power points. If you later relinquish your noble adept attack powers through retraining, you lose the power points you gained from the earlier choice." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="thPrimGrd" name="Primal Guardian" description="{i}&quot;The world has suffered more than any slave, yet life still flowers in a few places. I have vowed to protect these places of pristine nature, and it&#146;s a promise I intend to keep.&quot;{/i}\nMuch of Athas is desolate and defiled, but the life of a world is difficult to quench altogether. In spite of the supernatural ruin visited over so much of the planet thousands of years ago, the vital force of Athas still flourishes in a few places&#151;the rain-misted jungles of the Forest Ridge, the green palm groves of hidden oases in the Tablelands, the majestic stands of giant cactus that dot the stony barrens in the wilds south of Tyr, creek-fed mountain vales, the dazzling blue waters of the Dragon&#146;s Bowl, and a thousand more secret refuges and lost springs.\n    Across the Tyr Region, sentinels stand watch over these surviving treasures, protecting them from pillaging or defiling at the hands of people too careless, desperate, or wicked to care whether their actions might murder one more piece of a gravely wounded world. These watchers and sentinels are the world&#146;s primal guardians, chosen by the spirits or selfappointed to defend the life of Athas.\n    Many primal guardians are hermits who live in or near the lands they guard. Legendary druids such as Enola, the mul guardian of the Dragon&#146;s Bowl, and Mearedes, the protector of the island of Shault, are excellent examples. Some of these individuals choose their tasks for themselves, freely taking up the mantle of guardianship over some rare and precious verdant patch hidden in the desert. Others are possessed by the primal spirits, haunted or maddened by visions and bound to the place of the land&#146;s need. Still other primal guardians belong to circles or brotherhoods collectively sworn to defend a wide area. Several such circles, consisting mostly of halfling druids and wardens, are scattered throughout the Forest Ridge. Another band known as the Crescent Circle works to defend the Crescent Forest between Gulg and Nibenay. Finally, a few circles are free-roaming orders or societies that keep watch over the whole of the Tyr Region, passing messages to each other and gathering to oppose great dangers when they arise.\n    Even if a primal guardian chooses a single locale to protect, he or she is free to wander the rest of the world. In fact, many guardians begin their careers with an extended time of wandering, learning the secrets of nature&#146;s balance throughout Athas and searching for the place of their calling. But even after this time comes to an end, the needs of all of Athas often draw a primal guardian into long journeys away from the place he or she wards.\n    Even more so than elemental priests, primal guardians are people of the deep desert and the remote wilderness. Where the elemental priests seek to instill reverence for the primal elements in the peoples of Athas, primal guardians seek to keep verdant lands hidden and unspoiled. Some conceal trails or wield magic to obscure their warded places, some lure dangerous beasts to lair in the right spot, some spread rumors of death and desolation, and a few kill anyone who comes across the place they are sworn to protect. A few lives are nothing when weighed against the life of the world, after all." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="thTemplr" name="Templar" description="{i}&quot;I have been entrusted with the full power and authority of our king. Where I am, he is too. What I deem right and just, he approves. What I condemn as seditious or criminal, he also condemns. I am the law.&quot;{/i}\nJudges, officials, and enforcers of the king&#146;s laws, templars are the embodiment of civic authority in the great cities of Athas. They form a privileged meritocracy of individuals who serve as the sorcerer-king&#146;s eyes, ears, and mouth among the populace&#151;and, as circumstances require, the heavy hand of crushing tyranny. Given broad discretion to enforce the king&#146;s will as they see fit, templars are often brutal and corrupt, using their positions to wring ruinous taxes and bribes from all who fall under their power. A sorcerer-king doesn&#146;t care about templars being corrupt, as long as they keep the city in good order.\n    Templars commonly enjoy broad powers to arrest wrongdoers, impose fines, and command soldiers or city guards to do their bidding in their home cities. Of course, higher-ranking templars can countermand these orders, so a low-ranking templar can&#146;t just commandeer the half-giants guarding a city gate and march off into the desert with them&#151;he would have to appeal to his superiors to approve his mission and request that guards be assigned to his command. Likewise, templars of a particular city-state have no civic authority in other cities or in places not under the direct rule of their king. Though the civic powers granted to templars are formidable in their own right, templars are not simply bureaucrats&#151;many are also formidable spellcasters, sanctioned to wield the terrible magic of the sorcerer-kings in the pursuit of their duties. In many cities templars are trained in arcane magic in formal academies and are bestowed with the ability to call upon their sorcerer-king&#146;s magical might through lengthy pacts.\n    The exact ranks and customs of the templar hierarchy vary widely from city to city. In Balic, templars are known as praetors and are elected to their positions (although a few elections end in unexpected upsets). The templars of Nibenay are exclusively female and are ceremonially wedded to the sorcererking. In Draj, templars are known as the Priests of the Moon and are charged with observing the civic worship of the king Tectuktitlay, who claims to be a god. Notwithstanding specific customs, all templars constitute a powerful, wealthy social class within their cities&#151;a social class highly invested in keeping each sorcerer-king the supreme master of his or her city-state.\n    Most templars revel in their positions and ruthlessly exploit the weak and the poor. However, a few are patriots who are truly concerned with what&#146;s best for their city and their fellow citizens. Some are reformers who seek to moderate the excesses of the system, and a rare handful are rebels seeking to effect change from within. Heroic templars likely hold these convictions." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thVelAll" name="Veiled Alliance" description="{i}&quot;For centuries, the sorcerer-kings have perpetrated a great lie. They claim that arcane power is innately evil, and all who wield it without their supervision must be destroyed. The truth is that arcane magic is a weapon, and like any weapon, it can be used for good or ill.&quot;{/i}\nArcane spellcasters are feared and reviled throughout Athas, but a secret society protects those who choose the path of the preserver: the Veiled Alliance. Cells of this cabal are located across the Tyr Region, mostly within the city-states. Each cell is independent and does not answer to any central authority. Leaders of each cell oversee and train a network of warriors, spies, and other capable agents&#151;especially those who use arcane power.\n    All Veiled Alliance activities are directed toward the protection of preserving and the downfall of defiling. Although individual members might take up other tasks, the organization holds no other purpose as more important. The boldest of these aims is direct opposition to the sorcerer-kings. The Alliance is therefore a rebel movement&#151;the only rebel movement worth speaking of in some cities. As such, members of the Veiled Alliance are eagerly hunted by the templars and agents of every surviving sorcerer-king and those who wish to curry their favor.\n    Any preserver who comes to the attention of the Veiled Alliance earns a degree of aid. Membership is another matter. A potential recruit must be trustworthy and gain sponsorship of an existing member.\n    The Veiled Alliance holds the following tenets:\n    &#149; Protect the path of arcane preserving, its practitioners, and those who support preservers&#151;especially the Veiled Alliance itself. Teach, aid, and liberate preservers and their allies. Do nothing that brings danger to a preserver&#146;s door.\n    &#149; Defilers are abominations that steal that which rightly belongs to everyone. In their weakness, they ruin the land and bring hostile attention to those who use arcane magic properly. Convert a defiler to the right path, or thwart and destroy the defiler without revealing the Alliance.\n    &#149; The greatest defilers, the sorcerer-kings, must be brought down. Only they have the power to destroy our path." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thWstNmd" name="Wasteland Nomad" description="{i}&quot;I would rather die in the desert free from tyranny than die under a sorcerer-king&#146;s booted heel.&quot;{/i}\nCivilization huddles behind the towering walls of the Seven Cities, citizens and slaves alike subject to the tyrannical sorcerer-kings and their power-mad templars. Life in the dusty streets of the cities might be easy compared to the harsh barrens of Athas, but the comfort and security the sorcerer-kings offer come at a terrible price. Freedom is just a dream, and countless thousands endure crushing poverty and injustice because it is the only way they know how to live. Only in the wide deserts and trackless wastelands beyond the grasp of the sorcerer-kings&#146; rule can people truly be free. The nomads&#146; lives are hard, but they are theirs to lead&#151;or spend&#151;as they see fit.\n    The Tyr Region is home to hundreds of wandering bands of herders, hunters, and scavengers eking out hardscrabble lives from the deserts. Nomadic tribes roam the stony barrens and crisscross the sandy wastes as they follow kank herds or seek out new water sources. Owing no allegiance to any but themselves, they are the only Athasians (other than the recently freed people of Tyr) who know freedom&#146;s sweet taste. Many nomadic tribes have rejected the city-states for generations, surviving despite the hardships by learning the desert&#146;s secrets and mastering the survival techniques needed to provide the bare essentials.\n    In addition to those who are born to the nomadic life, there is no shortage of fugitives from the cities who hope to join them. Deserters, escaped slaves, and other refugees flee their homelands and the fate they would face if they stayed, preferring to risk their lives in the certain hardship and probable death the wastelands promise. Some find new homes alongside the nomadic tribes. Others go it alone, becoming hermits. But the desert claims most, with thirst, hunger, and exposure taking their toll until nothing remains but a slow, lingering death. Those who survive this grim test of survival are the toughest, the strongest, and the most willing to do what they must to meet whatever struggle they face.\n    The sorcerer-kings loathe the wasteland nomads, seeing them as nothing more than rabble and brigands who thieve and murder to make ends meet. In their eyes, the nomads are a cancer, weakening the sorcerer-kings&#146; legitimate governments. Nomad tribes must contend not only with the environment, but also with the city-states&#146; armies and patrols, which range the lands to round up new slaves to toil or fight or die, depending on the templar who seizes them. For this reason, and of course the never-ending quest for food and water, nomads must stay on the move." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thWilder" name="Wilder" description="{i}&quot;I have no idea why my mind holds such power. Some claim that everyone on Athas has a psionic capacity, but must first unlock the secrets of the Way.&quot;{/i}\nThroughout the world, from city-states to slave tribes to nomadic clans in the wastes, people spontaneously develop psionic abilities. Without formal training, these wilders manifest blunt, simple disciplines. Though well-trained savants scoff at the crudeness of the wilders&#146; techniques, they are well aware of how powerful an unleashed mind brimming with psionic energy can be. Some wilders create bursts of fire or magical force, making their thoughts incarnate. Others batter through their enemies&#146; mental defenses and cause grievous psionic anguish. A wilder isn&#146;t limited solely to outward manifestations of power, though. Many first learn how to alter their own bodies to make them far tougher, quicker, or stronger than normal. Wilders are most potent when they harness &#147;psychic surges,&#148; brief flashes of psionic energy that ripple through their minds and temporarily heighten their psionic abilities.\n    In the city-states, people see wilders as dangerous and unreliable. All too often an untrained wilder uses his or her ability against unsuspecting neighbors, or loses control of a power barely held in check&#151;with disastrous consequences. In many cities, templars scour the children of nobles and commoners alike for signs of psionic power, and see to it that these discoveries are carefully trained to control their gifts and guard against disaster. Outside the cities, it&#146;s a different story. The psychic surges that wilders manifest are simply another advantage in the fight for survival in the savage lands outside the sorcererkings&#146; domains. Each tribe treasures any wilders that appear within its ranks. As long as they help out, they&#146;re treated well.\n    Becoming a wilder requires no formal training. In fact, trying to control and develop psychic surges can cause those powers to function poorly. A wilder might practice blasting rocks to learn how to manifest his or her inherent disciplines quickly and in the right spot, but that&#146;s all there is to it. Concentration is vital to a wilder, but mentors and formulas are worthless." compset="Theme"></thing>

  <thing id="thDRDsrt" name="Dead Rat Deserter" description="{i}&quot;Me? Betray the gang?&quot; I said. Then the steel came out, and I barely made it away with my skin.{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Human, half-elf, or halfling\nThe port city of Luskan squats along the northern frontier of the Sword Coast. It is a den of thieves and murderers that attracts criminals like moths to a bright-burning flame. Luskan is controlled by a consortium of gangs, war chiefs, and would-be rulers, few of which last more than a season.\n    The Dead Rats are one of the exceptions.\n    That thieves&#146; guild has earned the respect and fear of the populace through a campaign of intimidation. Its members are known for their stealth, their ruthlessness, and their treachery. It is rumored&#151;correctly&#151;that the most deadly members of the gang are wererats. Like the creatures from which they derive their power, the Dead Rats can penetrate any safe house, no matter how secure. Initiation into the gang involves a blood ritual with one of these wererats, imbuing members of the guild with a sneaky and twitchy demeanor, particularly on nights of the full moon.\n    Every member of the gang is fiercely loyal to a captain named Toytere&#151;a halfling bard noted for his ability to see the future. Whether he truly possesses such sight or not, &#147;King Toy&#148; has never fallen to any of the attempts made to overthrow him. He has frequently rooted out would-be betrayers before they act, and he punishes anyone who attempts to leave the gang. However, your own split from the Dead Rats was a more complicated affair.\n    It wasn&#146;t that your last job went bad. Not exactly. You made off with less than you expected, but like a good Rat, you gave over the one-quarter share due to King Toy and resolved to enjoy the rest. The next night, when you returned to your safe house, you were taken prisoner by wererat marauders and brought before King Toy. The halfling accused you of planning a mutiny and expected you to understand his need to purge his gang of disloyalty. His bodyguards drew their steel.\n    Much blood was shed that night, but you escaped&#151;barely alive and thanking Tymora for your good fortune. You fled Luskan, nigh penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name. Your destination was the nearest safe haven you could manage&#151;the comparatively civilized city of Neverwinter, several days&#146; journey to the south.\n    Exhausted, not knowing whom to trust, you thought at last that you had found somewhere to rest and ply your trade once more. Any good thief could spot the coin to be made or taken in this disorderly city. Perhaps your flight from Luskan was good fortune in disguise&#151;you won&#146;t have the gang&#146;s dubious protection here, but you&#146;ll be free to keep all of your booty. Here you could build up wealth and power, and perhaps eventually return to Luskan to take your revenge on those who had wronged you.\n    Well, that was your plan before you got here, anyway.\n\n{b}Dead Rat Deserter Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the body of the rat power.\n{b}Dead Rat Deserter Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Stealth checks.\n{b}Dead Rat Deserter Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain the hybrid bite power." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thDmnSpn" name="Demon Spawn" description="{i}&quot;Am I evil? It&#146;s in my blood. But let my actions, rather than my appearance, show you my true nature.&quot;{/i}\nEncounters between demons and mortals end almost always in swift death for the mortals. Demons live to destroy everything they can until they are destroyed themselves. This violent behavior makes it rare for demons to consort with mortals, yet here and there across the planes, one can find mortals who have demonic blood flowing through\ntheir veins. Called demon spawn, most such creatures display wild, destructive evil similar to that of their demonic sires.\n    Unraveling the mystery of how demon spawn come to exist requires some background about how mortal races interact with the Abyss. Lolth instructed her chosen people in demonology ages ago, and her priestesses sometimes call forth demons to sire draegloths with willing initiates. Similar ceremonies might be found in other dark societies. Other kinds of demon spawn descend from incubi. Sages believe that incubi were devils that followed Graz&#146;zt into the Abyss when he sought to conquer its first layer. Despite their new home, these incubi retain their basic nature, and they still trouble the natural world with nocturnal visitations that sometimes result in demon-blooded children. However, because the Abyss changes and corrupts all it touches, the most common way that demon spawn come into existence is through exposure to abyssal energy.\n    Few demon spawn show evidence of their demonic heritage as soon as they are born. In fact, most look like normal mortal children, visually unremarkable. The transformation might start gradually, first with small horns breaking the skin on the forehead and later vestigial bat wings emerging from the shoulder blades. Demon spawn who conceal or downplay these features can avoid attracting attention or, if they desire, pass as tieflings.\n\n{b}Demon Spawn Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} Your origin becomes elemental.

  <thing id="thDvlPwn" name="Devil&apos;s Pawn" description="{i}What do you mean, those cultists seemed to know me? I don&#146;t know what you&#146;re talking about.{/i}\nThroughout Faer&#251;n&#146;s history, the North has ever been a breeding ground for cults, whether they serve devils, demons, or any of a thousand other dark masters. The last decades have grown progressively darker, presenting a great opportunity for cultists that promise protection from the terrors of the frontier&#151;at the comparatively small cost of eternal loyalty and secrecy. Or so the stories and tales go.\n    In reality, most of the cults that operate in the North have no deific connections, but are composed of indolent noble scions using the threat of darkness to gain romantic favor or to intimidate business rivals into closing up shop and skipping town. In such cults, young nobles claim to supplicate devils for the sake of their own jests, then drink themselves into oblivion while waiting for their servants to clean up the mess.\n    You used to belong to one such false cult&#151;or at least you thought you did.\n    It seemed like a good idea at the time&#151;allying with powerful individuals in Waterdeep in the mutual pursuit of authority, pleasure, and coin. Now, however, you&#146;ve made a terrible mistake&#151;one that you might end up paying for with your eternal soul.\n    Although you come from a noble bloodline, you&#146;ve never been particularly wealthy or influential. In the cult, however, you could rub shoulders with powerful and wealthy noble heirs who are excited to delve into the dark. You saw the potential in making important connections to your fellow noble scions, in the hope of securing a good marriage when you finally decided to settle down.\n    At your infrequent rituals, celebrants would gather around braziers of white-hot coals and invoke the power of strangely named beings. Chanting would ensue, along with tedious and false religious mummery. Nothing ever came of these rites, of course, and each secret conclave would eventually devolve into the more important business of drinking, scheming, and hedonism. It all seemed harmless.\n    Then one day, you were late for a meeting. When you arrived, it was to discover a ritual chamber covered in blood and gore. Your fellow cultists had been brutally dismembered as by a storm of ravaging claws and fangs. The central brazier burned with an unbelievably hot flame, drawing your attention. Enraptured, you stepped toward it, unable to resist. Fire flared, driving into your chest like a lance as it burned you, body and soul.\n    When you awoke, it was in your own bed, far from the scene of the cult&#146;s massacre. You were happy to dismiss the memory as a nightmare&#151;until you glimpsed a mark on your chest that made the nightmare real. You bear a crimson brand now&#151;a sigil that you somehow recognize as the mark of Asmodeus. What it means, you have no idea&#151;but the implications terrify you.\n    Tricked, confused, and scared out of your mind, you fled Waterdeep for a place where you might hope to hide from those who know you. In N everwinter, you have spent uncounted days looking over your shoulder and dreaming of treachery, violence, and fire.\n    You seek to gather allies to your side, fearful of what the power that binds you has in store. However, you hesitate to share your dreadful secret with them&#151;and the dark dream that has begun to haunt you, wherein you betray those closest to you.\n\n{b}Devil&apos;s Pawn Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the hellfire and brimstone power\n{b}Devil&apos;s Pawn Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +4 bonus to Diplomacy checks made to interact with devils, duergar, devil cultists, and other creatures devoted to devils.\n{b}Devil&apos;s Pawn Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain resist 10 fire.

The hard truth is that this celebrated virtue is a myth&#151;what distinguishes nobles from everyone else are the circumstances of their birth. Money, land, privilege: none of these things ensure good character and high ideals. In fact, such boons often create the worst villains.\n    If the masses pierce the veil of pomp and circumstance and see the noble for who he or she truly is, that vaunted individual is bound to tumble from great heights to wallow in the filth of the fallen. As a result, the aristocracy works hard to preserve the illusion, to maintain at least the veneer of respectability. Waging war against scandal and rumor, nobles fight to preserve their lifestyles, their fortune, and their lives.\n    No matter how cunning, some nobles succumb to temptation and forget their fragile position. Perhaps it was a careless moment, maybe it was a full assault on his or her character&#151;no matter, the damage is done.

  <thing id="thEarthFgr" name="Earthforger" description="{i}&quot;Elemental earth resonates in my soul.&quot;{/i}\nStrong, durable, and implacable, earthforgers embody elemental earth. They can manifest its power in defense or as a weapon, drawing energy from the stones or releasing it outward to hold enemies back. Earthforgers wield great power, but such ability comes at an even greater price. When they grasp this elemental magic and take it in, earthforgers are reborn as elemental creatures.\n    Dwarves pioneered the techniques of earthforging long ago; many sages believe that the race&#146;s first steps toward mastering elemental power occurred when the dwarves were enslaved by the giants, and those efforts led to the birth of the galeb duhr race. While extracting precious metals and gemstones from deep under the mountains, dwarf miners in that long-ago time came across primordial shards, crystallized magic left from creation. Using these shards, the dwarves found they could shape stone more easily, while also being able to endure even greater punishment. An unknown number of dwarves succumbed to elemental power&#146;s temptations, losing themselves to its magic, but enough resisted and proved mighty allies in the uprising that led to the dwarves&#146; exodus from cruel enslavement.\n    Other races have stumbled across earthforging under similar circumstances. Goliaths learned to use elemental earth from the stone spirits who watch over their mountain camps. Svirfneblin, gnomes who have long dwelt in the Underdark, use earthforging to evade drow slavers and destroy other hostile humanoids.

  <thing id="thEleInit" name="Elemental Initiate" description="{i}&quot;Inner harmony is a balancing of elements.&quot;{/i}\nElemental initiates follow a philosophy grounded in the understanding of the four elements and their influence over mortal bodies, hearts, and minds. One who would become an initiate withdraws from ordinary life to seek wisdom in a setting free of distractions, such as a monastery, a remote temple, or the dojo of a famous teacher. In some societies, the philosophy of the elements is widely known and respected as a path all should seek to progress along during the course of their lives. Among other cultures, these teachings are regarded as exotic or are unheard of. No matter the viewpoint of others, the path of the initiate is one of truth seeking and selfknowledge above all, a lifelong search for meaning and understanding.\n    Before heading into the world, most elemental initiates lead ascetic lives. They own little more than the robes on their backs, and they eschew luxuries and intemperate behavior as distractions from the path to which they devote themselves. An initiate strives to curb passions rather than allowing those passions to rule. An elemental initiate might be a student who preserves ancient tomes, a martial arts disciple who studies the four elements, or an anchorite absorbed in the exploration of the mind in the wild and lonely places of the world. Philosophically minded initiates devote hours each day to study, discourse, and observation of the world around them, while others dedicate their time to meditation and exercise. In and around the daily discipline of the monastery or temple, common chores and tasks are shared among all members of the order.\n    Typical elemental initiates are content to remain in their hidden temples and remote monasteries all their lives, devoting themselves to the study of their philosophy. However, some believe that they must travel widely, to pass on their learning and to absorb new lessons from the world outside the monastery walls. Other initiates take up a life of humble service, using their unusual training and abilities to help others. Adventuring elemental initiates come from the latter two camps.\n\n{b}Elemental Initiate Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a +2 proficiency bonus with unarmed attacks, and your unarmed attack can deal 1d6 damage instead of 1d4.

  <thing id="thEscSlave" name="Escaped Slave" description="{i}&quot;No one is my master&#151;not anymore. You think you&#146;re free? At least I had bonds to break. You can&#146;t even see the prison that surrounds you.&quot;{/i}\nThe cities of the sorcerer-kings crouch upon the backs of slaves. Slave bones litter their alleys. Slave blood makes mud in the dust of their streets. Almost everywhere you go in the city-states you see someone with a yoke around the neck and eyes cast toward the ground. Tyr presents the only exception, but Tyr has depended upon the labor of slaves just as much as any other city. Even it sells criminals into slavery beyond its walls. How long can such &#147;freedom&#148; last?\n    Slaves have always been a part of Athasian society. A harsh world calls for harsh justice. Those who cannot obey the laws that protect all or who are not smart enough to bow before those stronger than themselves do not deserve the water it takes to keep them alive. People become slaves by angering or offending those more powerful than themselves. A slave might have owed a debt, stolen a crust of bread, or not bowed low or fast enough when a person of importance passed. Citizens are declared slaves for owning items desired by nobles, for being captured instead of killed during war, and for knowing information above their station. Those born to slaves are slaves owned by the mother&#146;s master. After all, the master lost work from the mother during pregnancy and must pay for the child&#146;s care. Such a child owes the master labor equal to the period of time until it can do the work of a full adult, and by then it has no doubt done something to warrant its continued slavery. Even the kindest master realizes that a child raised in slavery is ill equipped for freedom and would likely die shortly after release. Though a slave lives a harsh life with no security, a master must provide for a slave&#146;s needs or accept the loss of that investment.\n    Once declared a slave, a person becomes property. Slaves change hands like money. They are won and lost in bets, sold at auction, and brought to market. Slave owners with slaves that have specialized skills or unusual attributes seek out buyers with particular needs. A slave owner can do what he or she likes with a slave, and it&#146;s no concern of anyone else. Masters expect slaves to work incredibly hard to earn their keep or face death in the arena, a quick execution, or whatever other cruelty the master dreams up.\n    Few slaves even dream of escape. The declaration of slavery is like a death sentence in its finality. Even if the leather and bone manacles are broken, even if the guards are evaded or killed, the rest of the world hates and fears an escaped slave. Those who aid an escaped slave&#151;even unwittingly&#151;can expect to become slaves themselves. Those who turn them in often receive a reward worth as much as half the slave&#146;s value. Only Tyr offers a slim hope of sanctuary, and if a slave has angered the master enough, many ways exist to take someone from that city.\n    An escaped slave&#146;s only hope is to see freedom as a rebirth. Old haunts, one-time friends, even family&#151;all need to be avoided for fear of being recognized and turned in. Hide the brand, disguise the tattoo, cover up the scars, explain the calluses away&#151;successful escaped slaves do all this and more. Escaped slaves must take up a new name, a new history, and if one can manage it, a new appearance. Some escaped slaves do all this, but the strong will and sharp mind such a life requires often drives successful escaped slaves back toward their former owners, exchanging one master for another: revenge." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thExplr" name="Explorer" description="Seekers of new lands and lost places, explorers are masters of the trackless wilderness. Formal exploration is not very common in the world; a few wealthy kingdoms and mercantile cities charter expeditions to distant lands or reward travelers who return home with descriptions of far-off places. Most explorers, however, are individuals whose interests or duties lead them to venture into places where other people rarely go. They can be hunters, scouts, pathfinders, merchants, or emissaries to distant realms. Pursuing their private interests or carrying out important missions entrusted to them leads these travelers into the wild places of the world.\n    Many explorers begin their adventures as professional treasure-seekers. Searching out legends about lost hoards, hidden artifacts, or unplundered tombs, they put their talents to use in locating the rich score that no one else has found. Other explorers are engaged in searches, quests, or missions that lead them to places no one has visited before. For example, an order of knights or wizards might charge its members with traveling the world to battle a specific threat. A few explorers are true wanderers&#151;travelers who feel compelled to see for themselves what lies beyond the next ridge or to seek out legendary challenges. Fortune or fame is of little concern to these wanderers; they live to satisfy their personal curiosity or to measure themselves against the dangers they overcome.\n    Regardless of individual motivation, explorers must master a daunting set of skills if they hope to be successful. They must be tough and enduring, capable of traveling great distances over difficult terrain, and must have the ability to survive the worst extremes of weather. They must be expert beast hunters and foragers with a talent for living off the land no matter where they are, since they&#146;re not likely to find friendly inns or trading posts once they leave civilization behind. A knack for direction is indispensable; roads are nonexistent in the wilds, and missing an important landmark or choosing the wrong turn off a poorly marked trail might be a fatal mistake. Finally, explorers had better be ready to defend themselves from the attacks of vicious raiders and hungry monsters.\n\n{b}Explorer Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You can tell which way is north, and you gain a +5 bonus to any skill check to avoid becoming lost, find your way to a specific location, or spot a distant landmark.\n    In addition, you gain the surefooted stride power.\n{b}Explorer Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Endurance checks. In addition, for the purpose of determining how far you and up to ten companions can travel in an hour or a day, treat the group&apos;s speed as the slowest member&apos;s speed + 1.

  <thing id="thFateDncr" name="FateDancer" description="Everyone wants good luck, but few have minds broad enough to embrace the whole of fate, sense what is meant to be, and follow that path. Those who do so learn to accept both the best and the worst that the world can offer. Fatedancers understand that what should not happen, cannot happen; the proper way to live is to embrace what must be. By accepting what fate offers, they gain more than peace of mind&#151;everything they do aligns with the true purpose of the world.\n    To know fate is to dance, for life compels one to quickly move from here to there, from one thought or place or event to another. Though outsiders believe fatedancers to be mercurial at best, random chance does not exist for those who embrace fate, only opportunities taken or missed. The future and the present are always exactly as they should be for fatedancers; such individuals exist in the moment. They get into a lot of trouble because of this stance, but they are usually lucky enough to get out of it. Theirs is the life of a vagabond, taking both good and bad fortune as it comes.\n    Any adventurer who believes in luck as a force can be a fatedancer. Martial characters most often choose this theme. They do not depend on any external source for their powers, so they are attracted to a path that depends on their own actions. To their minds, reliance on arcane magic or the power of the gods is an attempt to circumvent what should happen.\n    Bards and rogues also have worldviews that encourage this way of life. Bards weave songs that tell of heroes&#146; fortunes and misfortunes and thus naturally respect the power of fate. A few follow this tendency further and learn to rely on it, even though they also use arcane magic. Rogues approach their lives with equal parts daring, skill, and luck, but many take to heart the idea that it is better to be lucky than skilled.\n\n    {b}Fatedancer Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You can have up to two Fortune Cards in your hand. You can still play only one in a round, but you can draw a card at the start of your turn if you have fewer than two cards in your hand.\n    {b}Fatedancer Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +4 power bonus to passive Perception checks to determine if you are surprised.\n    {b}Fatedancer Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} Once per encounter, you can discard two Fortune Cards at the start of your turn to search your deck for any one card.

  <thing id="thFeyBTamr" name="Fey Beast Tamer" description="{i}&quot;Of course you can domesticate an owlbear! Want me to show you how?&quot;{/i}\nWhen the natural world was young and humanity was in its infancy, callous elf nobles intentionally opened fey crossings between their realm and the natural world, sending dangerous monsters through to terrorize early mortal civilizations. Many of humanity&#146;s oldest folk tales concern these first encounters with creatures such as owlbears and displacer beasts. Although eladrin scholars have tried to disprove the assertion that their ancestors were responsible, there is no doubt that an unusual number of stories passed down by human cultures involve such occurrences.\n    However troublesome or malicious the ancient elves might have been, they inadvertently gave the people of the natural world a familiarity with fey creatures. During these formative years for human culture, contact with Feywild beasts had a great impact; the magic of that plane touched hearts and souls in the mortal world. As a result, some members of mortal races developed an affinity for dealing with creatures from the Feywild. They could command the beasts of the fey realm just as mortal nobles could command their subjects. Renowned fey beast tamers, many of whom have been immortalized in story and song, rode into battle with powerful denizens of the Feywild at their side.\n    Generations passed, empires rose and fell, and wars came and went. Bloodlines that once had been strong were thinned out by centuries of marriage and expansion. The beast tamers who commanded armies of fey creatures died out, and every generation of their offspring grew weaker in their control over fey beasts until the ability was almost forgotten.\n    Once every few generations, however, a mortal is born of parents who still have strong blood ties to the ancient beast lords. Such individuals grow up with the inherent ability to bond with fey creatures. Though many never realize their full potential, some discover&#151;through chance encounters&#151;that they can influence fey beasts by sheer willpower. These special mortals usually bond with a single creature, forming a connection that is as strong as the one shared by soldiers who serve together in battle.\n    You are one of these rare individuals with an ability that reaches back to the dawn of civilization. You have formed a connection with a fey creature and can command it to aid you and protect you from harm. Over time, as you develop this bond further, you will begin to absorb the inherent magic of the creature and find yourself capable of things you never thought possible.\n\n    {b}Fey Beast Tamer Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} Choose one of the following creatures: blink dog, displacer beast, fey panther, or young owlbear. You gain it as your fey beast companion.\n    Your fey beast companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way that any other creature can be. It has animal intelligence, so you can communicate with it only at a basic level (like a trained pet), and it doesn&#146;t understand complex ideas.\n    Your fey beast companion&#146;s level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attack values are determined by your level, as noted in its statistics.\n    Your companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your fey beast companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your fey beast companion regains all its hit points.\n    If you die or your companion drops below 1 hit point, it retreats back into the Feywild. If that occurs, you can use one of these two ways to call it back.\n    Minor Action: You lose a healing surge, and your companion appears in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value.\n    Short Rest or Extended Rest: At the end of the rest, you lose a healing surge, and your companion appears in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.\n    {b}Fey Beast Tamer Level 5 Features (5th level):{/b} You have combat advantage against enemies in your fey beast companion&#146;s aura.\n    {b}Fey Beast Tamer Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You can communicate normally with your fey beast companion and other creatures of the same kind." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thFrCrftr" name="Firecrafter" description="{i}&quot;I feel the flames of a thousand suns burning in my heart.&quot;{/i}\nFire creates and destroys. With fire, one can transform raw iron into a useful blade, clear a field of crops to halt the spread of a disease, or lay waste to anything that stands in one&#146;s way. Fire is also the element of emotion, of passion and intensity, of new ideas and revelations. Firecrafters embrace elemental fire, using it to forge themselves into something new, something made from fire and yet bound in humanoid form.\n    Firecrafting finds its roots among the primitive cultures in the world. Legend holds that the primordial Imix gifted mortals with fire in order to destroy them, and it was Ioun&#146;s intervention and knowledge that gave mortals the wisdom to control it. Ioun enabled mortals not only to use fire for light and warmth, but to bend it to their will with magic.\n    Firecrafters come by their power through the same channels that other individuals learn to use elemental magic. Some might transform into elemental creatures after discovering a primordial shard. An imprisoned primordial might grant a boon to a particularly loyal follower, while mere exposure to the Elemental Chaos could be the catalyst that awakens a latent elemental quality in others. Regardless of his or her history, a firecrafter leads a lonely life. People fear firecrafters, and with good reason.\n\n    {b}Firecrafter Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} Your origin becomes elemental.

  <thing id="thGlmWEms" name="Gloomwrought Emissary" description="Gloomwrought, also known as the City of Midnight, is one of the few bastions of civilization within the Shadowfell. It is a place of treachery and subterfuge, where only the savvy survive. Unscrupulous political houses, whose special interests far outweigh the concerns of social needs, handle governance of the city while Prince Rolan the Deathless serves as the de facto leader. With all the political intrigue surrounding daily life within the city, many wealthy and powerful individuals ceaselessly work to expand their spheres of influence. One way in which they accomplish this is by sending out special envoys that work to further their interests and the interests of Gloomwrought. These Gloomwrought emissaries are crucial to the expansion of the city&#146;s political reach and are the eyes and ears of the noble houses.\n    Joining this elite corps of specialists can be difficult, and whom you know&#151;not what you know&#151;is important in most cases. In some cases, an existing agent of a house recruits emissaries passively by following them for some time and observing them from a distance so their skills and abilities can be gauged. This gives the recruiter time to evaluate and pass judgment before contacting the potential emissary and bringing him or her on board. In other cases, emissaries are cultivated from within the house and are trained from a young age, a method that has a high success rate in developing bright new talent.\n    Your life as a Gloomwrought emissary depends largely on the master you represent. You might serve as a crafty spy, or a hired assassin sent to eradicate an enemy of your house. You could serve Gloomwrought as a diplomat by using your silver tongue to help spur, or incite, bloody conflict. No matter how you choose to serve, you are an important part of the city&#146;s social landscape.\n\n    {b}Gloomwrought Emissary Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the strike from the shadows power.\n    {b}Gloomwrought Emissary Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Diplomacy checks and Streetwise checks.\n    {b}Gloomwrought Emissary Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} Once per day, you can reroll a Bluff check, a Diplomacy check, or an Intimidate check.

  <thing id="thGuardian" name="Guardian" description="Members of elite societies or military orders dedicated to the preservation of a worthy ideal, guardians are vigilant warriors ready to defend their sworn charges with their lives. Although strength and fighting spirit are useful to guardians, most pride themselves on using their heads, not their hands. Guardians believe that the service they offer doesn&#146;t permit personal glory-seeking or needless risk-taking. If the causes or the people they protect can be defended only by head-on battle, then guardians do not hesitate to draw their weapons. On the other hand, if the best way to carry out a mission is to employ stealth or subterfuge, or flee the scene, so be it.\n    A guardian&#146;s orders vary widely from realm to realm. Some exist to protect another group or organization, such as the high priests of a particular god, the members of a wizards&#146; guild, or a family line harboring a great destiny or a magical legacy. Some are sworn to protect a rare or treasured site or item, such as the forge-flame burning eternally in the heart of a dwarven citadel, or a mighty artifact of good that a demon lord seeks so that it can destroy the item. A few guardian orders are mercenary squads of the highest quality, priding themselves on offering the best, most loyal protection that gold can buy. However, most guardians are sworn to the service of a kingdom or realm. They serve as bodyguards to the royal family and high-ranking members of court, protect the treasures and the secrets of the realm, and undertake missions of vital interest to the crown.\n    {b}Guardian Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the guardian&#146;s counter power.\n    {b}Guardian Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks.\n    {b}Guardian Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} Choose one creature to be your bonded charge.

Orphaned, abandoned, or mistreated as children, guttersnipes can grow into hard-bitten, cynical adults. Marked by the lower-class manners and speech patterns of the poorest quarters, guttersnipe heroes struggle to be seen as something more than the dregs of society. Guttersnipes live their lives under constant suspicion from the more fortunate people in the world. Most are seen as greedy, lying cutpurses, footpads, or ruffians who would slit a throat for a handful of silver pieces. Common people openly distrust them, constables and watch officers routinely harass or question them, and aristocrats are surrounded by watchful guards or counselors who make it a point to keep the riffraff, especially dangerous riffraff, away.\n    Under this cloak of distrust, some guttersnipes choose to live down to others&#146; expectations, nursing bitter grudges against their &#147;betters.&#148; Others desperately try to escape their poor origin by concealing their street manners and lack of education behind carefully rehearsed facades of gentility; they dread the day when someone sees through the disguise. Some happy-go-lucky souls choose not to be troubled by suspicions and slights, refusing to be defined by others&#146; ill-informed judgments. Finally, benefactors who see potential in them pluck a lucky few guttersnipes out of the streets and give them a chance to make something of themselves. A powerful wizard might detect a spark of greatness in a street urchin and teach the boy or girl a few tricks; a compassionate priest might offer a poor child a chance to become an acolyte in a temple. As recounted in more than one legendary tale, guttersnipes are sometimes picked up from the streets by royalty or high nobles and adopted after doing some great service or showing tremendous pluck.\n    Whether a guttersnipe meets life with wry wit or scheming self-interest, every one is a survivor who excels in recognizing and seizing opportunity. Guttersnipes who through good fortune or hard work leave the streets behind to become wizards, clerics, or wards of nobles might not look or sound much like the beggar children they once were, but inside they still have the quick wits and daring that got them noticed in the first place.\n\n{b}Guttersnipe Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the running slash power.\n{b}Guttersnipe Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} When you buy an item, you pay 90 percent of the listed price.

During that time, he created untold numbers of clones to house his identity in case his body met with disaster. The clones were kept in stasis and hidden in safe places throughout Undermountain and the lower reaches of Waterdeep. Though Halaster expected death at every turn, not even he foresaw his destruction at his own hands. His essence was cast across the planes when he lost control of a powerful ritual, and before he could find his way back to one of his clones, the Spellplague struck. Only Halaster knows for certain what happened next.     \n    You were supposed to be one of Halaster&#146;s clones&#151;of that much you&#146;re certain. The safe house in which you awoke was filled with the Mad Mage&#146;s writings, which were meant to help him reorient himself upon assuming a new body. But something went horribly wrong.\n    You are not Halaster. Your body is far different from what is shown in the paintings and illustrations of the master of Undermountain. Your personality and skills seem drawn from another source. Yet Halaster is there too, his maniacal laughter bubbling up from the recesses of your mind.\n    It has now been more than a hundred years since Halaster&#146;s death and the onset of the Spellplague, and you have nothing but questions. Undaunted, you set out from Undermountain to create a life and a history for yourself; you hope to find the strength to keep your internal madness at bay.

  <thing id="thHarpeAge" name="Harper Agent" description="{i}You fight for your freedom? Well, I fight for the freedom of all.{/i}\nBards who chronicle the past age sing of the Harpers, a secret society dedicated to advancing the cause of good across Faer&#251;n. In the group&#146;s glory days, its members included figures of legend such as Storm Silverhand, whose beautiful voice matched her ferocity in battle, and Arilyn Moonblade, a half-elf wielder of powerful and ancient elven magic. The Harpers passed from existence in the wake of the Spellplague, but the organization was reborn sixty years ago and is now based out of the city of Everlund, several hundred miles northeast of Neverwinter. Its stated purpose is to stop the encroachment of the expanding empire of Netheril.\n    You grew up hearing tales of the Harpers&#146; exploits and have long sought to do your part to stem the tide of darkness. You&#146;ve always had a facility for deception and intrigue, coupled with a strong sense of right and wrong. As you grew older, you searched for the best way to put those skills to good use. You journeyed to Everlund to enlist in the group, whereupon you were given a task to complete in order to earn your Harper pin.\n    You were dispatched to Neverwinter, there to contact a local Harper agent named Cymril and lend your services to the Sons of Alagondar. Cymril, in addition to being one of the few Harpers in the city, is the leader of the Sons of Alagondar. This underground resistance movement opposes the imperialistic aims of Dagult Neverember, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, who has established himself as the &#147;Protector&#148; of Neverwinter during its reconstruction. The Harpers believe that Neverember&#146;s intentions are less than noble, and that he seeks to expand his mercantile empire for his own gain at the expense of the people. They are sure that, with his ruthless methods and suspect alliances, Neverember plans to usurp the throne of Neverwinter and build a cutthroat empire on the Sword Coast.\n    On your arrival, you learned the hard way that Neverember&#146;s treachery runs deeper than even the Harpers know. You were included among a band of rebels on a nighttime reconnaissance mission led by Cymril. All of a sudden, your world turned inside out when a squad of Neverember&#146;s mercenaries ambushed your group. You avoided the initial assault by ducking into an alcove&#151;where you watched as Cymril began cutting down your comrades! Clearly, she was working in league with the soldiers. One of Cymril&#146;s lieutenants turned on her and wounded her fatally just before he himself was cut down by the mercenaries.\n    When the mercenaries moved on, they left the bodies of their victims (including Cymril) in the street as a warning to other dissidents. Before you left the area, you had the foresight to pluck Cymril&#146;s Harper pin from her vest, lest it fall into the wrong hands.\n    Was Cymril truly a traitor to Neverwinter&#146;s cause, or was she working as a double agent? You can&#146;t be sure. What you do know is that when both the Sons of Alagondar and the Harpers got wind of what had happened, they immediately suspected that someone in the ambushed group was working for the other side.\n    As the newcomer, you bear the brunt of the suspicion of both groups. The city&#146;s rebel forces have fractured since Cymril&#146;s death into disorganized and ineffective war bands. Discovering which of the few Harper associates in Neverwinter you can trust is important to you. However, if you have to work alone to get the job done, that&#146;s what you&#146;ll do. Your main goal is to ascertain the truth about Cymril, and in the process of doing that, you seek any means you can to thwart Neverember&#146;s true plans for the city.\n    As a rogue agent, you work without official Harper support, and are free to use your own methods and make your own decisions regarding whom to trust. Each new day is an exciting and dangerous game of masks&#151;guessing who speaks the truth, who offers you lies in the hope of securing an advantage, and who is the true enemy in any given situation. You follow a morality of your own&#151;one that seeks the good in any situation, without compromise and without being afraid to take the fight to those who oppose you.\n\n    {b}Harper Agent Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a Harper pin." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="thHntBld" name="Haunted Blade" description="When a mortal commits a cold, calculated act of violence with a sword, an axe, or some other weapon, he risks being cursed by the dark powers to a life of fear and suffering. Perhaps the warrior put an entire village to the sword in an effort to capture and kill one escaped criminal. Perhaps he desecrated a holy temple, shattering sacred relics with a great warhammer. Or perhaps he betrayed and executed an innocent friend with a headsman&#146;s axe. From such unspeakable deeds are born the haunted blades, warriors doomed to carry the terror of their victims with them for the rest of their days.\n    Even though some haunted blades commit their crimes in the name of a noble cause, they, like all of their number, have been singled out by the dark powers for a unique gift. The violent deed leaves the haunted blade forever changed. Henceforth, when such a warrior draws his weapon, his countenance takes on the appearance of a creature infused with dark power, and he becomes terrifying to behold. The sins from his past resonate with a haunted blade when he ventures into battle, and the fear and horror his innocent victims once felt emanates from him in waves of sheer terror. For a brief moment, the haunted blade is able to share with his enemies the deep fear he endures every day.\n    Whether a haunted blade has been chosen by the dark powers is open for debate. Some scholars posit that spirits of ancient magic weapons roam the domains of dread, and these spirits are drawn to acts of darkness like moths to a flame. Under this theory, the dark spirit gains access to the haunted blade&#146;s mind, lurking in the deep recesses of his brain. Although the spirit is unable to take control of its mortal host, when the haunted blade draws his weapon, the ancient spirit surges into it. The drawn weapon often becomes encased in shadow, and ebon tendrils snake forth from its surface, hungering for blood. Regardless of whether a haunted blade has been touched by the dark powers or invaded by a shadowy spirit of an ancient weapon (or perhaps both), the force inside the warrior will attempt to steer him down the path to evil.\n    Haunted blades often depend on their companions for support in their dark and treacherous journey. Many such characters are truly repentant, and seek out allies of good moral codes to help them make up for their past mistakes. Sometimes the darkness inside a haunted blade bubbles to the surface, however, and one might commit an act that its allies find troublesome. Such an act might be murdering a creature that has surrendered in battle, torturing a prisoner for information, erupting in sudden violence while in the peaceful confines of a city, or turning on a trusted ally.\n    A haunted blade often hears the whispers of the dark force inside him, urging him toward acts of betrayal, but this path is by no means an inevitable one. If you&#146;re interested in using this theme, talk to your DM and the other players to ensure that a character who might suddenly turn on his allies (which is entirely the player&#146;s decision; this theme does not mandate such an occurrence) is something the group finds fun to roleplay and an acceptable addition to the party.\n    Haunted blades carry within themselves the seeds of what it means to be a dark lord. At some point each one must choose which direction his or her life will take. Will a haunted blade continue the descent into darkness, winning more favor from the dark powers until finally becoming a dark lord? Or will he instead choose the path of virtue, trusting in his companions to show him the way back to the light? Until that day of redemption comes, when a haunted blade strides into battle with weapon drawn, his enemies will cower before him. They know instinctively that this darkness is not to be trifled with; it is a force of pure dread in a world already filled with horror.\n\n{b}Haunted Blade Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the blade of nightmares power.\n{b}Haunted Blade Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} When you make an Intimidate check, you can roll twice and use either result.\n{b}Haunted Blade Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You can substitute your Charisma modifier for your Dexterity modifier when making initiative checks." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thHrDlzn" name="Heir of Delzoun" description="{i}Yea, the blood of Delzoun flows in me veins! I come a&#146;seeking Gauntlgrym, and I durn&#146;t care how many tried and failed! Well, of course I have me a plan! Buy the next round, and I&#146;ll tell ye all about it.{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Dwarf\n\nThousands of years ago, in an age of great empires, the dwarven realm of Delzoun thrived. Said to be the pinnacle of dwarven culture, Delzoun was a place whose citizens were happy and productive, trading in relative peace with their neighbors. When Netheril was laid low by the folly of the mage Karsus, it was not only the Shadovar that suffered.\n    Like so many of the dwarves of the North, your family claims direct descent from Delzoun. However, with so many making that same claim, who knows if any speak the truth? In private, for much of your life, you&#146;ve had your doubts.\n    Then seventeen years ago, during the Summons, the ghosts came.\n    Perhaps only one in a thousand dwarves has made a believable claim to have seen them&#151;but you are one of those chosen few. Clad in the vestments of ancient times, the ghosts spoke with a voice that only you could hear. Pleading in the manner of dwarves in the most desperate need, they begged for help&#151;not for themselves, but for all your kind. They spoke of an &#147;awakening beast&#148; that must not be allowed to rise. And before they vanished, they begged you to come to them&#151;in Gauntlgrym.\n    Gauntlgrym. What dwarf of the North has not dreamed of that place? Most people think it a myth or a ruin cast to rubble ages ago, but dwarves know different. Dwarves feel the truth in their bones.\n    For a time, Gauntlgrym was the capital of Delzoun. The underground city was the grandest settlement in the North&#151;perhaps in all the world. Doors cast of pure mithral opened at a dwarf &#146;s slightest touch. A forge burned there so mighty that items of enchantment could be made without magic. So great was Gauntlgrym that humans, elves, halflings, and gnomes all begged to live beneath its roof, and were welcome.\n    Yet Gauntlgrym fell long ago&#151;first to orcs, then to humans who claimed it, then to mind flayers, and finally to the mists of history. Rumors have placed it in numerous locations. Some claim to have seen it or have maps to it, but lunatics and scoundrels assert many things. The Summons drew many to search for it, including you.\n    In the end, your search has brought you to the Neverwinter region, where Gauntlgrym might yet lie hidden. Some of your family think you mad. Others burn like the sun with pride, for you have the opportunity to prove their claim of Delzoun blood. Many have sought Gauntlgrym before; others do so now, because you are not the only dwarf to have seen the phantoms or to claim the blood of ages. But if you can succeed, you can elevate yourself and your family name to the heights of dwarven annals and legends. You can restore the remnants of your people&#146;s greatest glory. And, just possibly, you can prevent the rise of an evil as great as that which destroyed Delzoun.\n    The dire warnings of the ghosts whose summons you obey weigh heavily on your heart. You have followed the rumors that bore the greatest ring of truth, but now that you&#146;ve reached Neverwinter, you know that completing your quest will require all the help you can get.\n\n{b}Heir of Delzoun Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain resistance to poison equal to 5 + one-half your level.\n{b}Heir of Delzoun Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a healing surge.\n{b}Heir of Delzoun Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +4 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks made to interact with dwarves." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thHrdLNmd" name="Hordelands Nomad" description="Between Faer&#251;n and Kara-Tur is a vast steppe, held through history by more than one ancient empire. Despite the area&#146;s turbulent past, the advent of the Spellplague, and the rise of the Tuigan nation of Ya&#239;munnahar, the folk of the Hordelands live as they have for centuries. Because the steppe offers few resources, all the nomads of the Hordelands&#151;Taan, as they call themselves&#151;are master riders and hardy survivalists. They rely on their mounts and livestock, as well as connections to nature and primal power, for survival.\n    People of the Hordelands venerate Teylas, the Sky Lord, who is called Akadi in Faer&#251;n, and worship Etugen, Earth Mother, known among Faer&#251;nians as Grumbar. Additionally, and to a lesser degree, the nomads idolize a plethora of other primal spirits. Some of these latter entities live in named places, such as oases, across the plains. Others represent important or fierce animals of the prairie.\n    Tribal customs among the nomads focus on pleasing the spirits as they seek to ensure that the elements remain in balance. Those living in the Hordelands believe that bad luck, such as an inability to find water, is the work of offended spirits. To aid them in their work with the spirits, the nomads use primal magic, and their familiarity with it grants them a sixth sense when it comes to spiritual influences. Not only do they gain closeness to the spirits that surround them, they can sense the presence of myriad fey crossings on the plains, which provides them with the opportunity to interact with fey creatures, too.\n\n{b}Hordelands Nomad Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain proficiency with the shortbow.

I won&#146;t let you.\nPrerequisite: Eladrin\n\nAnyone with a passing knowledge of history knows of Iliyanbruen&#151;the great kingdom of the mortal world that was home and sanctuary to the elves after the dissolution of the empire of Illefarn. Like the empire that spawned it, Iliyanbruen also fell in time. Many of its folk left for Evermeet, even as others retreated into the Feywild. With powerful magic, the elves of old transported most of Sharandar, the capital city of Iliyanbruen, to the Feywild. Their plan was for Iliyanbruen to rise once more on the site of the original home of the elven people&#151;but events seldom align with the intentions of those who live them.\n    Although Iliyanbruen rose once more, the Feywild was no empty frontier. The forces that drove the ancient elves to first leave Faerie for the world still held sway in many places. Enemies of these returned folk&#151;particularly the Winter Court and the Twilight Fey&#151;arrayed against them. Treants, dryads, centaurs, firbolgs, satyrs, and other creatures that might once have been allies saw the Iliyanbruen eladrin only as invaders.\n    Generations of battles and legends later, Iliyanbruen endures as a realm, its borders several days&#146; walk from the ruins of Sharandar. That land has always been your home, and your people have lived there in relative peace for generations.\n    With the coming of the Spellplague, everything changed. Faerie and the world were brought into conjunction once more. Some eladrin grew eager to determine what had become of their worldly home. This was easier said than done, however, for a covey of hags and their dark servants had taken over Sharandar, making travel difficult at best. Although you initially had little real interest in old Iliyanbruen beyond mild historical curiosity, you were quick to join the effort at ousting the evil fey from the region.\n    Several of your friends were injured or slain before your people reclaimed the territory and established an outpost in the ruins. From there, you and your fellows ventured back into the mortal world where the eladrin of Iliyanbruen had not stepped for centuries.\n    You were horrified at what you found. Though you had expected the kingdom&#146;s ancient tree-cities to have fallen into disrepair, you found many of them looted as well. Their structures were ravaged and desecrated, with ancient treasures of statuary, artwork, and holy icons all stolen away.\n    Fierce debate arose among the fey of New Sharandar. Some, enraged by what had occurred, demanded that the eladrin reenter the mortal world in force, wreaking vengeance on any who lingered near the ruins of Iliyanbruen&#151;or even the entirety of what was once Illefarn. Others of calmer mien said that the eladrin should reclaim the greatest ruins of Iliyanbruen, restore them to the glory of old, and take vengeance only on those directly responsible for their debasement. However, for that effort to work, the eladrin must learn who has despoiled their ancient home.\n    You are determined to find out who has ravaged the ruins, which are already weakened by time. In discovering who stole your ancestral treasures&#151;and what creatures deserve your wrath&#151;you intend that justice be meted out appropriately. You are driven not only by anger and vengeance, but also by a sense of urgency. For you know that if you fail, the wrathful among your people will gain the upper hand, spilling the blood of the guilty and the innocent alike.\n    Many eladrin have made the natural world their home as they seek answers&#151;and you are one of them. Some set out in search of allies, hoping that fabled Evermeet or one of the elven kingdoms of old still exists. Others have set their sights on the areas closer to Neverwinter Wood, feeling certain that those responsible for the desecration of your birthright have not gone far.\n    It appears that you were right. Even as you began your investigation of the ruins of Neverwinter, you arrived late for a rendezvous with your fellows to find them slain by powerful magic. Whoever the wrongdoers might be, they outnumber you. You know you need allies in the fight against them, but if news of the slaughter spreads among your people in the Feywild, it could mean war. Even worse, Iliyanbruen might decide to sever ties with the past once and for all.\n\n{b}Iliyanbruen Guardian Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} When you use fey step, you can take one adjacent ally with you.

  <thing id="thInfPr" name="Internal Prince" description="{i}&quot;Within me burns the might of an infernal lineage. Those who stand against me face the wrath of the Nine Hells.&quot;{/i}\nEager to extend their influence into the world, the lords of the Nine Hells have long mingled their essence with those of chosen mortals to create bloodlines tainted with infernal power. Although the link between an infernal progenitor and his or her fiendish scions might stretch over many generations, the strength of the bloodline persists, and those &#147;blessed&#148; with such a legacy are potent tools of evil. Inheritors of a hellish strength, these infernal princes can call upon an array of diabolical abilities.\n    Although many infernal lords have engendered mortal bloodlines, Asmodeus and Mephistopheles have been the most prolific. Infernal princes who can trace their lineage back to either archdevil are by far the most common of their ilk, and both Asmodeus and Mephistopheles actively involve themselves in the lives of their progeny. An infernal prince might be unaware that his or her blood and soul churns with the essence of an archdevil, and the diabolical power resulting from this union typically lies dormant until the character reaches young adulthood.\n    In the case of an infernal prince bearing the blood of Asmodeus or Mephistopheles, a tutor sent by the archdevil arrives when the dark urges that herald a diabolical awakening manifest in that individual. This tutor is often a cleric or a warlock devoted to the archdevil, and his or her first order of business is to remove the fledgling prince from home and the influence of parents, who remain unaware of their child&#146;s ancestry because, for whatever reason, their own potential was never great enough to warrant the attention of an archdevil. The tutor&#146;s goal is to ensure that the student embraces his or her heritage and serves the archdevil whose blood flows through his or her veins. An infernal prince is still mortal, however, and the decision to embrace evil and follow in the footsteps of one&#146;s progenitors is his or hers to make. An individual must consciously choose the diabolical path to gain access to its power.\n    Infernal princes can rise high in the service of the archdevil whose blood they share, and they are quite skilled at leading other mortals into darkness. Within an adventuring party, an infernal prince plays the part of a committed comrade and takes pains to keep his or her true allegiance a secret. The character works to lead companions into wickedness, subtly pushing them to commit acts of evil that seem innocuous but form a slippery slope into spiritual corruption. Once these companions are committed to evil, the infernal prince inducts them into the service of his or her patriarch, swelling the ranks of mortals who serve the interests of the Nine Hells.\n\n{b} Infernal Prince Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a +1 power bonus to fire attack rolls.\n    In addition, you gain the hellfire heart power.\n{b}Infernal Prince Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Diplomacy checks.\n    Once per encounter, when you roll a 5 or lower on a Bluff check or a Diplomacy check made against a humanoid of the natural origin, you can reroll the check. You must use the second result.\n{b}Infernal Prince Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} The first time you become bloodied each encounter, you regain the use of hellfire heart. If you then use hellfire heart on the creature that bloodied you, the power deals 5 extra fire damage." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="thInfslave" name="Infernal Slave" description="{i}&quot;I know what lies beyond the veil. That&#146;s why I&#146;m sending you in my place.&quot;{/i}\nFree will shapes the infernal slave&#146;s identity. Whether the decision was made after careful consideration or in the heat of passion, the infernal slave agrees to sacrifice the future&#151;a dimly understood afterlife, a shadowy doom not yet realized&#151;in exchange for some immediate gain.\n    The boon could be something as base as wealth. Treasure chests filled to bursting, a prized jewel long coveted, a successful business venture: all translate into mortal comfort. The gain could be satisfaction of lust, carnal, material, or otherwise&#151;a longing that would not be denied. The greatest lure, however, is power. Command over other people is intoxicating, as is the ability to do as one wishes without fear, without persecution, without regard for consequences.\n    These prizes are great temptations. To the infernal slave, they are immediate and full recompense for a sacrifice payable far off in the future. Some claim that the slave is doomed to an unspeakable fate, suffering and dying a thousand deaths at the hands of the cosmos&#146;s most vile entities, those god-killers called devils. But what do the naysayers truly know. Maybe the consequences are far less dire. One never knows what the future holds. Given the immediacy of the boon and the remoteness (and sheer conjecture) of the payment, the infernal slave considers the arrangement a true bargain.\n    In the end, an infernal slave comes to understand that he or she has bargained badly. The boon turns out to be fleeting, ruined by personal choice or circumstance. The bargainer becomes worse off than he or she was prior to making the deal. In this wretched state, the full horror of the pact is revealed and annihilation&#146;s imminence bears down with a hammer&#146;s force. The slave sees his or her doom in the shadows, hears the screaming souls as they burn in hellfire&#151;a waking nightmare that never ends.\n    At that point, panic and horror shape the slave&#146;s existence. Escaping this fate comes to eclipse any other consideration. In this way, the devils gain a mortal thrall&#151;a vessel to spread evil and corruption. Evil appears the only way out for the misguided fool who desperately seeks to escape the doom he or she willfully accepted.\n\n{b}Infernal Slave Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the hellfire touch power.\n{b}Infernal Slave Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} While you are not bloodied, you gain a +1 power bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will.

These private detectives use a combination of skill, intuition, well-placed informants, and magic to solve crimes, locate missing persons, and unearth sensitive information. In short, an inquisitive is the perfect career for an adventurer.\n    Most inquisitives labor as private detectives, operate in urban areas (although their investigations can take them far afield), and work alone or with a small group of close associates. Those in larger cities, however, sometimes band together to form detective agencies or professional guilds. Such agencies might employ one to four inquisitives, as well as support staff such as alchemists, sages, and diviners. The larger and most successful organizations might have over a dozen detectives and numerous other operatives. Inquisitives who work independently or in smaller towns might operate out of taverns, restaurants, or even their own homes.\n    Because the profession is not legal or welcome in every jurisdiction, inquisitives can have a complicated relationship with local law enforcement. Some watch commanders and local constables view inquisitives as necessary evils, despite keeping several on retainer to investigate complex or high-profile crimes. Overwhelmed subordinates can have a much more pragmatic view. Thus, a successful inquisitive cultivates reciprocal relationships with low-ranking officers and watch members, since they&#146;re an excellent source of jobs, information, and favors.\n    Inquisitives perform a wide variety of services that can be grouped into three broad categories:criminal investigation, crime prevention, and information acquisition. Most inquisitives will take on any such cases. Some inquisitives and their agencies, however, especially those located in larger cities, specialize in a particular field. To solve cases, inquisitives utilize magic and skills to analyze evidence, conduct surveillance, interview witnesses,\ninterrogate suspects, and obtain privileged information by using a network of informants.\n\n    {b}Inquisitive Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} Work with your DM to build a small network of contacts&#151;three to five individuals. It takes 2d6 hours for your contacts to respond to your requests, so you can turn to your network for help only once per day.

  <thing id="thIronwrgt" name="Ironwrought" description="{i}&quot;The weapon is only as strong as the hand that wields it.&quot;{/i}\n\nAir, earth, fire, and water eclipse the other expressions of elemental essence found in the Plane Below. They are, after all, the most dominant forms, and most elemental creatures incorporate one or two of these fundamental elements into their being. Less prominent elemental provinces include all manner of phenomena from magma to ice, and smoke to metal. Although devotees of these lesser forces might be rarer than others, they are no less capable than other users of elemental magic. The ironwroughts prove this fact time and time again.\n    The first ironwroughts appeared not long after human empires extended into the Elemental Chaos. Faced with teeming demons, mad slaads, and hostile elementals, as well as physical changes the settlers experienced after being exposed to the plane, the best warriors filled their time perfecting fighting techniques. The heavy armor, the metal weaponry, and their iron resolve all inclined them toward the lesser-known province of elemental metal. It took no time for these warriors to adopt metallic characteristics, becoming less human and more like the creatures they were sworn to fight. Calling themselves the ironwrought, they proved instrumental in throwing back the elemental hordes long enough for their people to establish colonies.\n    From these early warriors descend the ironwrought societies still found across the Elemental Chaos and in the natural world.

  <thing id="thJnssry" name="Janissary" description="The races of geniekind have a reputation for carrying off mortals to serve as slaves in the cities and palaces of the Elemental Chaos. Few mortals realize, however, that being the slave of a genie is far from an unpleasant existence. These servants lead lives not much different from those of the common workers, servants, soldiers, and artisans found toiling in and around the castles and palaces of nobles in the world. Even the most ordinary genie&#151;whether dao, djinn, efreet, or marid&#151;fancies itself a great lord with a high and royal title. It regards the everyday business of administering its estates and overseeing its property to be a task utterly beneath its attention. Instead, these genie overlords leave most of their affairs in the hands of a select caste of trusted, loyal slaves known as janissaries.\n    Some janissaries are part of a genie&#146;s household staff and have little freedom to travel, but most large genie cities and realms are host to a whole class of janissaries who are considered slaves of the throne, rather than of a particular genie. Most such janissaries serve as elite soldiers, city officials, or highly valued artisans and engineers. They are allowed to own property, bear arms, travel, marry, and engage in whatever pursuits they like, although most are guards or bureaucrats in the ruler&#146;s service. Adventuring janissaries usually come from this group and are free to do as they please&#151;until a high-ranking genie commands a service from them. It&#146;s not unusual for janissaries to venture into the mortal world on various errands, then stay on to seek their fortunes when their original mission is completed.\n    Although janissaries are often rich, comfortable, and entrusted with great authority, they are still subject to the whims of their genie masters. Goodnatured genies, such as djinns and marids, treat their janissaries well and bestow honors and offices on servants who show cleverness, reliability, and efficiency. Daos and efreets, on the other hand, are cruel and overbearing, so they naturally value servants who use brutality and viciousness when attending to their duties. In most realms janissaries enjoy at least some legal protection against poor or capricious treatment, but in return they are expected to police themselves stringently and to comply with any order or request a genie gives them.\n\n{b}Janissary Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a +5 power bonus to Endurance checks against environmental dangers.

  <thing id="thKnHops" name="Knight Hospitaler" description="Hospitalers are members of a religious order of compassionate warriors sworn to provide care and comfort to the poor, the sick, and the injured. Their chapter houses are in many large cities, offering comfort and healing to those in need of it. However, hospitalers are most famous for their work out in frontier lands, where they aid travelers (especially religious pilgrims) who are in distress far from any other help. Fortified hospices stand near difficult mountain passes, at remote river crossings, and in lonely clearings in dark, monster-haunted forests. Many are the travelers whose lives have been saved by hospitalers watching over dangerous roads in the wilds.\n    In addition to serving as healers and sponsoring almshouses and hospices throughout the land, hospitalers are valiant soldiers. Hospitaler orders keep roads safe from bandits and monsters, especially routes used by pilgrims journeying to holy sites. They defend important shrines and protect high-ranking members of the priesthood. Finally, hospitaler orders are the backbone of many crusading armies seeking to confront great evils in far lands.\n    Like chevaliers, hospitalers are seen as knights of a sort and are entitled to a number of privileges in most realms. They are responsible for maintaining estates and strongholds, overseeing justice in their demesnes, and marshaling companies of soldiers to protect the lands around their estates. However, they are loyal to religious leaders, not secular rulers. Hospitaler commanders hold high ecclesiastic rank as well as knightly titles and estates. In practice, most hospitalers split their time between the estates for which they are personally responsible and the chapter houses or hospices of their order. Titles and estates are awarded on the basis of seniority and family influence, so low-ranking hospitalers rarely have estates of their own. Instead they serve as seneschals or lieutenants to landed hospitalers, swear fealty to the king or high nobles of the nearest realm, or take up arms in a crusade.\n\n{b}Knight Hospitaler Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the shield of devotion power.\n{b}Knight Hospitaler Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You can request food and lodging for yourself and your traveling companions from any temple affiliated with your hospitaler order, or from any noble household.

  <thing id="thMrnr" name="Mariner" description="Mariners are intrepid folk who take to the world&#146;s great oceans and seas, living on the rolling waves aboard ships of all kinds. Though they hail from many races and walks of life, mariners have one thing that unites them&#151;a love of the sea and the freedom it brings. Mariners set their course for wherever the winds take them, whether dodging icebergs in the arctic circle, clipping through the azure waters of the tropics, or crossing vast seas to unknown lands. The crisp sea air is the siren that turns the mariner&#146;s rudder to dry land, drawing him or her to see what&#146;s beyond the watery horizons.\n    No two mariners share the same story. Their backgrounds converge only in the fact that they have made a life for themselves aboard a ship. For most, this will have been a decision made by choice. Many find ample opportunities to seek wealth by traveling from port to port to trade goods from distant nations. Experienced mariners sometimes seek rich patrons willing to finance daring voyages. Plotting courses to new lands&#151;and claiming them in the name of their patron&#151;can bring wealth and fame to the mariner. Others might have dedicated their lives to the royal navy, waging war against the realm&#146;s enemies by sea. These naval captains are the stuff of legends. Few mariners reach such lofty status, yet even the rankand-file who crew the ships are rewarded with more adventure and gold than they would ever gain while on land.\n    Although many raise sail for love of adventure or as a profession, those who spend most of their lives on ships have darker experiences. These folk are the dread pirates who plunder the coasts. For these individuals, the sea might serve as a refuge from the hangman&#146;s noose, but most pirates adopt their ways after realizing that the expansive holds of merchant fleets contain enough wealth for a hundred lifetimes. Fighting, drinking, and the feel of gold spilling through fingers are pleasures enough to draw even honest mariners to live the pirate&#146;s life.\n    The importance that great bodies of water play in various cultures means that members of many races become mariners. Though the great fleets of humanity can dominate the trade lanes, flotillas of halfling skiffs ride the rivers far inland. The graceful prows of eladrin ships glide through the shimmering waters of the Feywild. Underground, dwarven barges cruise through subterranean rivers. Still other mariners are independent members of a tribe, paddling swift canoes or catamarans from island to island.\n    Whether one is a humble sailor, a dashing captain, or a cutthroat pirate, all mariners share a love of freedom. Riding the winds gives them independence unknown by the masses on dry land. The open sea, fleet winds, the song of gulls, and the promise of adventure pull mariners more strongly than the ebbing tide.\n\n{b}Mariner Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} While you are aboard a ship, you gain a +1 bonus to any skill check or ability check related to life at sea. Examples of such checks include an Athletics check to scale rigging, a Diplomacy check to issue orders to surly crew members, a Perception check to spot a dangerous reef, or an Intelligence check to plot a course using the stars. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +2.\n    In addition, once per round when you make an Acrobatics check to balance or hop down, you can roll twice and use the higher result.\n{b}Mariner Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to initiative checks.\n{b}Mariner Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You ignore difficult terrain when you shift.

  <thing id="thMercenar" name="Mercenary" description="Sellswords, spellslingers, soldiers of fortune, freebooters&#151;regardless of their appellation, mercenaries are heroes who work for pay. Capable warriors and spellcasters are always in demand, and the more desperately they&#146;re needed, the better paid they are. More than a few young heroes begin their careers by striking out in search of opportunities to turn their fighting skills into high-paying jobs. Although most people expect that mercenaries do only what they&#146;re paid to do, it&#146;s not unusual for a heroic mercenary to show a soft spot after coming across people in need who can&#146;t afford his or her services. It might not be good business, but one of the advantages of being unencumbered by loyalties and obligations is the ability to follow the dictates of one&#146;s conscience whenever they strike.\n    Each adventuring mercenary falls into one of two broad categories: retainer or freelancer. A retainer signs on with a patron, providing service in exchange for a regular stipend or salary. Nobles, merchants, and royal officials often find it useful to keep a small number of talented troubleshooters at their beck and call for escorting them during travels, guarding their homes or interests, or dealing sternly with rivals. Retainers are naturally expected to follow their employers&#146; orders, but they spend less time looking for work.\n    A freelancer hires on for one specific job at a time or works on speculation&#151;for example, hunting down outlaws who have prices on their heads or searching out prospective employers who have problems in need of fixing.\n    Mercenaries might be more flexible in their standards than high-minded characters who serve others without thought of reward, but that doesn&#146;t mean they&#146;ll do anything for money. Heroic mercenaries won&#146;t hesitate to walk away from jobs that require them to murder, rob, or oppress commoners. Likewise, the best mercenaries pride themselves on their loyalty and professionalism even under difficult conditions. Any thug can take a paymaster&#146;s gold to swagger around and look capable when danger&#146;s far away, but honest mercenaries don&#146;t slink off into the shadows when called upon to earn their pay. Building a reputation for having standards and being reliable is the best way to impress future employers. Some mercenaries, however, are little more than brigands who are perfectly happy to earn a living through plundering and banditry if they can&#146;t find more respectable work that pays them well enough. Heroic mercenaries therefore face a good deal of suspicion and prejudice from people who expect sellswords to behave like thugs.\n\n{b}Mercenary Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the takedown strike power.\n{b}Mercenary Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Intimidate checks and Streetwise checks.\n{b}Mercenary Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} While you are bloodied, you gain a +1 power bonus to all defenses." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="thMsshpn" name="Misshapen" description="When a person commits an act of brutal violence without the use of a weapon other than one&#146;s bare hands, the dark powers might consign the perpetrator to live afterward as one of the misshapen. The offender could be a thief who strangles his partner so he can keep treasure for himself, or a bounty hunter who holds his prey underwater until it drowns, or a jealous sibling who pushes his brother off a cliff, or a corrupt magistrate who tosses exculpatory evidence into the flames. Anyone who acts in such a way risks being noticed and cursed by the dark powers. When the powers decide to take notice, the individual is surrounded suddenly by the mists and experiences a gruesome transformation. The limb that carried out the foul deed becomes monstrously twisted and malformed. These unfortunates make up the ranks of the misshapen, and each must endure a continuing existence of solitude and suffering.\n    Most misshapen keep to themselves and hide their deformed limbs beneath their cloaks. (The afflicted appendage is almost always an arm or some other extremity used for gripping and manipulation, even if the limb that committed the evil deed was not actually of that sort.) Although a misshapen&#146;s mutated limb might be viewed by many (including that individual) as a horrible detriment, it does provide some benefit to the character, who gains extraordinary abilities from the altered appendage.\n    Despite the potential usefulness of these transformations they suffer, misshapen tend to avoid the villages and settlements of Ravenloft. When they travel through civilized areas, misshapen often meet suspicion and fear, because the common folk lack compassion or tolerance for things they cannot understand. Many a tale has been told of villagers chasing a monster from their midst, and in some of those cases the creature might not have been a true monster at all. As such, most misshapen would rather not risk capture or death at the hands of an angry mob. Occasionally, however, such a character does encounter kindness from strangers, and some societies might even welcome a misshapen into their midst.\n    Most often, the curse of the dark powers alters one of the misshapen&#146;s limbs to resemble that of an animal or monster, such as an ogre&#146;s fist or a tiger&#146;s paw. Over time, the curse might worsen or spread. The behavior of the affected limb could become unpredictable. It might occasionally act of its own accord, without its owner&#146;s consent, suddenly snaking out to grab a victim by the throat, or striking a creature that has angered or irritated the misshapen. In such cases, the offending limb responds to the emotional state of the misshapen and acts on his or her subconscious impulses. A misshapen beset with this kind of affliction must take special care to control or suppress angry reactions, lest the altered appendage suddenly come to life.\n    Some misshapen seek only to rid themselves of this curse, and will go to any lengths to obtain knowledge that might aid them in eliminating their condition. Other misshapen view their affliction as a blessing from the dark powers and see themselves as an evolutionary improvement over their unaltered companions.\n\n{b}Misshapen Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the grasping limb power.\n{b}Misshapen Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Athletics checks and Acrobatics checks.\n{b}Misshapen Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} When you push, pull, or slide an enemy with a melee attack, you can increase the distance of the forced movement by 1." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thNwNbl" name="Neverwinter Noble" description="{i}I have a destiny and a birthright to claim&#151;for the good of the people of the North.{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Human\n\nTwenty-seven years ago, before you were even born, the city of Neverwinter perished in a great conflagration that slew its people and scattered survivors across the north. Since then, the angry earth has calmed, inviting people to return to the ruins of this once-great settlement. Dagult Neverember&#151;the imperialist Open Lord of Waterdeep&#151;has declared himself a distant relation of the old rulers of Neverwinter, and thus claims to be the rightful heir to their holdings. He has installed himself as Neverwinter&#146;s Lord Protector until the city is rebuilt and order is fully restored&#151;at which point he is expected to name himself king. Given Neverember&#146;s control of Waterdeepand the military and magical power that control grants him, few have expressed any desire to dispute his claim&#151;at least not until a true heir is found.\n    A true heir such as you.\n    You are a last scion of Neverwinter&#146;s former ruling family. Your mother was a noble who fled the city during the cataclysm, wounded during her escape and driven to madness by pain and grief. When she perished shortly after you were born, a noble family of Waterdeep&#151;the Thanns&#151;took you in and raised you as their own.\n    You grew up with heroic stories, poetry, and the best education a young noble could have. With Neverwinter in ruins and your kin all dead, your adoptive parents thought it best to hide from you their knowledge of your tragic past. However, in the aftermath of Lord Neverember&#146;s seizing power in Neverwinter, you have finally been told the truth.\n    At first, you weren&#146;t certain what to do. In one moment, it felt as though you had lost two families&#151;the old and the new. You had never seen Neverwinter, but what you had heard of the city didn&#146;t make it seem like a place worth claiming. If you ignored your birthright, you could continue to live a life of relative ease and luxury in Waterdeep.\n    Eventually, you came to see your problem a different way. Though your new family will always be there for you, whatever remains of your connection to Neverwinter is in imminent danger of being swept away. You have the opportunity to know your lost past&#151;even if only through the relics of that past. And by claiming what belongs to you, you&#146;ll exchange a life of idle nobility for one of responsible royalty.\n    Yet you are not naive enough to believe that the path forward will be easy. Reclaiming the city is not as simple as declaring your identity. Neverember commands an army of warriors and mages, and his influence ties him to hundreds of powerful individuals around the Sword Coast with their own reasons to crush an upstart like a flea.\n    You need proof of your ancestry&#151;something in the ruins of the city that can verify the story that was told to you. If you&#146;re lucky, you might find a symbol of your royal past such as a crown or a scepter to lend credence to your claim. Then you will have to prove yourself a champion&#151;to win the hearts and minds of the people as you convince them that it is you, not Neverember, who deserves to rule a reclaimed and rebuilt Neverwinter. Only then might you restore the city to its past glory and do honor to your blood heritage.\n    You recognize the need to gather allies, both to defend the city against its many foes and to protect yourself against those who want to prevent you from reclaiming your birthright. Whether your fellows know your true heritage or not is up to you.\n\n{b}Neverwinter Noble Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the take heart, friend! power.\n{b}Neverwinter Noble Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} While you flank an enemy, your allies gain a +1 power bonus to attack rolls against that enemy.\n{b}Neverwinter Noble Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +4 bonus to Diplomacy checks made to interact with citizens of Neverwinter.

  <thing id="thNoble" name="Noble" description="Heroes arise from all levels of society. Some begin their stories as peasants, some as rough-and-ready homesteaders from frontier lands, and others as well-off townsfolk, but some heroes are born into privilege. Noble-born heroes enjoy opportunities and comforts that many commoners can only imagine, but if they are blessed with wealth and influence by the luck of being born to high station, then they are also obligated to do more with the gifts they have been given.\n    The definition of nobility varies from land to land and race to race. In most realms, the aristocracy falls into three groups: low nobility, high nobility, and royalty. Low nobles include landed knights, squires, baronets, lairds, hidalgos, seigneurs, and other holders of minor titles and estates. Typically a low noble&#146;s lands rarely extend for more than a day&#146;s ride or include more than one good-sized town. Most low nobles owe allegiance to a nearby high noble, who might bear a title such as baron, count, duke, marquis, earl, landgrave, or prince. High nobles can be major powers, since they are wealthy enough to raise their own armies and are near-absolute rulers over the lands of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of low nobles. High nobles in turn owe their allegiance to the sovereign of their realm. Royal titles come in a bewildering variety, ranging from king or queen to archduke, high prince, tsar, khan, shah, or something even more exotic. Of course, the ranks of the nobility also include everyone in the titled landholder&#146;s family. A member of a noble family who isn&#146;t the actual titleholder is generally called lord or lady.\n    An adventurer from a noble family is rarely the family&#146;s active titleholder or ruler. Governing and defending a fief is an important duty, and the affairs of the kingdom leave little time for dungeon delving and adventure seeking. Most noble heroes are therefore untitled lords or ladies who are closely related to a titleholder. A hero might be the heir apparent to the title of head of the family, standing only one heartbeat away from a noble seat, or he or she might be further removed from the order of succession, free to indulge a taste for adventure with little concern for ever becoming a baron, a duke, or a king.\n    Regardless of whether they hold titles or might inherit them, nobles still enjoy a number of perquisites of their high stations. Common officials and lawkeepers can arrest or hinder nobles only in exceptional circumstances. Important people in nearby lands are careful to treat nobles with respect, even deference, for fear of offending a powerful family. Nobles are also wealthy by the standards of most people. As long as they&#146;re anywhere near home, nobles can afford fine meals, excellent lodgings, and sufficient allowances and stipends to maintain themselves in comfort.\n\n    {b}Noble Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the noble presence power.\n    {b}Noble Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain one common suit of magic armor, weapon, or neck slot item of 6th level or lower.\n    {b}Noble Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Diplomacy checks and Insight checks." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="thOccult" name="Occultist" description="Occultists believe the cosmos is trying to tell them something. They see signs everywhere&#151;in the arrangement of leaves upon a pond, the flight of birds, or the positions of the constellations in the night sky&#151;and work diligently to decipher their meaning. Many occultists also dabble in numerology, seeing mathematics as but one of the languages by which the enigmatic forces of creation seek to communicate. Every crypt explored, every ritual mastered, every ancient text translated leads an occultist closer to unlocking the mysteries of the multiverse.\n    Highly sought after for their ability to divine meaning from even the most mundane objects, occultists might advise powerful individuals or even whole settlements. Some serve as royal astrologers and foretell the consequences of future actions from the patterns of the stars. Others are village augurs, determining the outcome of the harvest by examining the entrails of sacrificial animals. A few set up shop as fortune-tellers, reading tea leaves or prophesying through the use of cards or crystal balls. Many occultists do not possess genuine powers of foresight but rely instead on observation and shrewd deduction to do &#147;cold reading&#148; on their subjects. Some do master and perform divination rituals, however, such as Hand of Fate, in their endless pursuit of knowledge.\n    Although a few occultists remain in one place, most choose to travel throughout the realms. They are fascinated by ancient civilizations and eagerly seek out archeological sites to learn the secrets of the past. The ruins of a once-great city, the tomb of a long-dead emperor, the abandoned castle of a vanished regent, or a vast underground library filled with decaying tomes&#151;the occultist greets each with wonder and a voracious appetite for knowledge.\n    Occultists apprentice themselves to willing masters, but they also attempt to bind powerful creatures to their service. In their quest to understand the nature of existence, they do not let abstract concepts such as morality stand in their way. They are just as likely to study a fiendish prince as they are a celestial servitor, although the former is more likely to kill the student than to impart any wisdom.\n    When dealing with powerful extraplanar entities, be they demons, primordials, or agents of deities, occultists learn to tread carefully. They scour the realms for arcane and divine rituals, collecting items such as sorcerous dust and blessed candles that can be incorporated into rituals to create warding circles. In this way they can safely imprison unwilling subjects, or bargain with the dark forces they summon without losing their heads in the process.\n\n    {b}Occultist Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain proficiency with tomes.\n    You can master and perform rituals in the binding category as though you had the Ritual Caster feat.\n    In addition, you gain the sign of the golden ram power.\n    {b}Occultist Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks and Religion checks.\n    {b}Occultist Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} When interacting with creatures that have an origin other than natural, you can use Arcana or Religion in place of Diplomacy and Intimidate.

Strange shapes half seen in the darkness. Eerie sounds that upon waking made you think of the sea. A sense of otherness, and of unseen watchers. Such disturbing nightmares afflict the minds of sensitive people throughout the North, yet in your sleep, a light parts the shadows.\n    When the nightmares come, a blue-green flame erupts to burn away the threats. When your eyes adjust, you find yourself in a grand library. As you walk a glittering hall between high bookshelves, the passage extends outward before you like a long road. You wake before you reach the end, no matter how fast you run. But as you open your eyes, a sound echoes in your ears&#151;the flow and gears of a water clock.\n    To you, the meaning could not be clearer. Oghma, god of knowledge and thought, is bidding you to go to Neverwinter and restore his temple, the House of Knowledge. An ancient homily revealed by your dream lies at the heart of your understanding. To swear &#147;by the clocks of Neverwinter&#148; was once a most solemn promise, so sure and perfect were the water clocks made by the artisans of that city.\n    Once, Neverwinter drew experts in art and craft from around the world, standing as a shining example of beauty and art. Now, the city lies in ruins. The temple to Oghma, broken by the destruction that claimed Neverwinter, could become the center of the city&#146;s renaissance. The techniques of lost craft guilds, the work of the region&#146;s finest artisans, secrets of architecture and engineering, as well as songs, scrolls, and items of enchantment&#151;all might be recovered from the temple&#146;s extensive archives. Ancient relics and lore now lost elsewhere in the ruins could be collected in the library for the use of all. The House of Knowledge could become the House of Hope.\n    You set out to Neverwinter to be a part of the city&#146;s restoration. You know you can&#146;t accomplish this task on your own, but Oghma will help you develop friendships with those who can assist you, and will aid you in crafting the alliances necessary to bring Neverwinter to life again. Because of your labors and guidance, the city will become a light in the darkness that threatens to swallow the North.\n\n{b}Oghma&apos;s Faithful Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the understand language power.\n{b}Oghma&apos;s Faithful Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain the sudden insight power.\n{b}Oghma&apos;s Faithful Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +4 bonus to Perception checks made to search." compset="Theme">

Those who do might become lords of the slime-covered caverns of the Underdark, and command oozes, jellies, puddings, and other aberrations to do their bidding. An ooze master regularly forsakes the comforts of traditional drow society to venture into the cold, wet, dark, and abandoned places of the earth. There, an acolyte of That Which Lurks can study the slimes of the Underdark, with only Ghaunadaur&#146;s insane whispers to keep him or her company. When an ooze master walks the halls of drow cities and settlements, he or she strives to keep a low profile, because strange mannerisms and a fascination with aberrant creatures serve only to draw unwanted attention.\n    An ooze master must fight constantly against whispers of madness that seek to consume the mind. Ghaunadaur desires only to devour the world, and Ghaunadaur&#146;s worshipers claim to hear his voice inside their heads, urging them down a path of destruction. With arcane power gifted by the ancient god, an ooze master calls forth corrosive goo to scar and maim opponents. An adherent that is lucky enough to retain some semblance of sanity normally exhibits only a few symptoms of Ghaunadaur&#146;s madness, but an episode of full-blown insanity can still strike at a moment&#146;s notice.\n    Worship of Ghaunadaur is forbidden in Menzoberranzan. Even the maddest of acolytes knows better than to invoke foul magic in the presence of Lolth&#146;s servants. Traveling with an ooze master is dangerous; many of the Spider Queen&#146;s agents have been trained to recognize the telltale signs of insanity.\n\n{b}Ooze Master Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the sudden slime power.\n{b}Ooze Master Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} When you make a Dungeoneering check, you can roll twice and use either result.\n{b}Ooze Master Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain acid resistance equal to 5 + one-half your level.

The eye grants the oracle influence over the minds of other creatures and the ability to see glimpses of the future. People fear and shun anyone with an evil eye, and often rightly so.\n    The Baleful Ritual of the Evil Eye causes an evil eye to appear. This ritual&#151;known to the fomorians, some of their servants, and a scattered few hags and spellcasters&#151;takes hours to perform and is extremely painful, involving burning oils, foul incense, and surgical incisions. Fomorians, well known for their wickedness and insanity, might order that the ritual be conducted for many reasons. A ruler might give an evil eye as a gift to a faithful servant one day, then issue one as a punishment to a prisoner the next.\n    Only the cruelest creatures consider gaining an evil eye to be a blessing. Evil fey such as quicklings and spriggans thrill at the power of an evil eye, and eagerly do the work of the fomorians in exchange for such a blessing.\n    Most oracles of the evil eye who undertake adventuring careers are gnomes or eladrin. Forced to undergo the ritual, they become outcasts from their home societies. They go off into the woods of the Feywild, never to be seen again, or they travel to the natural world to lurk on the fringes of society and use their evil eyes to get what they want. An oracle of the evil eye might be adventuring in search of a way to dispel the curse and return to the warmth and comfort of society.\n\n{b}Oracle of the Evil Eye Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the gaze of the evil eye power.\n{b}Oracle of the Evil Eye Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Intimidate checks.\n{b}Oracle of the Evil Eye Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if you already had low-light vision." compset="Theme">

Although some are devout wielders of divine power, many have no magical abilities at all; the term &quot;ordained priest&#148; in this context means someone who holds the social position or occupation of being an ordained official of the faith. For example, typical village priests have no powers comparable to the attack and utility prayers of adventuring clerics. They hold a different sort of power: the deference of their neighbors, the trust of the authorities, and the respect of the great majority of the citizenry who rely on their counsel and good judgment. Ordained priests might serve as teachers, soldiers, confessors, advisors, students, magistrates, or powerful rulers, but whatever their role in society, they inspire and influence ordinary people to live up to the standards of their faith.\n    Ordained priests enjoy a bewildering variety of preferred titles. Depending on the land in which they&#146;re found and the faith to which they belong, they might be known as curates, elders, friars, imams, lamas, prelates, shepherds, rectors, or vicars. In some realms, temples are huge, powerful states within the nation, ruling over wide estates guarded by armies of temple guards. Ordained priests in rich, influential hierarchies such as these might have duties or titles that have little to do with ministering to commoners, and instead they could wield authority as judges, lawkeepers, and bureaucrats. However, most faiths in the mortal world are smaller organizations that rarely have much influence outside their own realm or kingdom.\n\n{b}Ordained Priest Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} Choose smiting symbol or shining symbol.

  <thing id="thOAdept" name="Order Adept" description="Great wizards are forged, not born. Natural talent and a quick mind are only the bare beginning of being able to wield the arcane arts. Achieving true mastery requires personal dedication and self-discipline, rigorous training, and access to libraries full of ancient grimoires and crumbling scrolls. In many places no special organizations or traditions exist to guide wizards and other arcane spellcasters along their way; magic-users come to their full powers and wield their spells as they see fit. But in other lands, magic is regarded as too important&#151;or too dangerous&#151;to be left in the hands of the self-taught dabblers. In these lands, magic is taught and practiced by members of special orders, guilds, societies, brotherhoods, and cabals who jealously guard access to their powers and seek to control their use.\n    Arcane orders arise for many reasons. Some exist for the purpose of preserving arcane traditions and instructing new spellcasters in arcane powers. Others organize the efforts of their members in the service of a worthy (or sometimes not so worthy) cause. For example, the Order of the Golden Flame is sworn to serve the crown of Cernall, and its members are granted extensive authority as royal officers. The Ruathar Eldoni is an order of eladrin wizards dedicated to the destruction of demons, its members traveling throughout the world and beyond it to deal with demonic incursions wherever they appear. The Emerald Orb is a meddlesome cabal whose members believe that wizards should rule over lesser mortals, and they work to gain inf luence over important rulers or to establish open magocracies. Some orders are large, formal hierarchies in which members are expected to obey the orders of their superiors, while others are small fellowships in which no one member is considered superior to his or her fellows.\n    An arcane order might operate openly or exist as a hidden society. Members of openly active orders typically proclaim their allegiance with a highly recognizable garment or symbol; for example, wizards of the Golden Flame wear a richly embroidered yellow cloak, and members of the Ruathar Eldoni often wear a silver star-shaped brooch or clasp. Other orders favor such identifiers as tattoos, unique hairstyles or grooming, or implements of a particular design. Members of secret orders avoid any outwardly distinguishing signs, of course, but often have secret signs they can use to prove their identity to others of their group&#151;for instance, a pendant worn under one&#146;s shirt, a ring that isn&#146;t very obvious to a casual viewer, or a brand hidden beneath robes.\n\n{b}Order Adept Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the argent rain power.\n{b}Order Adept Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks.

  <thing id="thOutlaw" name="Outlaw" description="The world is a hard place. Many people are forced to do unfortunate things to survive; some are wrongly accused, and others find that the laws and structures that are meant to shield the weak from their depredations protect oppressors. Outlaw heroes are wanted by the authorities in their native realms. They risk arrest every time they show themselves, and they must develop a talent for disguise, take to a life in the wilderness, or master the art of the quick escape if they want to avoid the executioner&#146;s axe.\n    Outlaws might come to be outlaws for a variety of reasons. An insecure tyrant might decree the destruction of a noble family that poses a threat to his reign, leaving the survivors destitute and hunted by royal authorities. A tragic misunderstanding or accident might condemn an individual, who is discovered standing over a murdered archmage&#146;s body with a bloody dagger in her hand. No one believes her when she tries to explain that she found him already dead. In a realm where the powerful are free to oppress the weak, standing up to a cruel official or lord who injures or mistreats someone can easily turn a hero into an outlaw. However, it&#146;s far more common for an outlaw to justly stand condemned for her actions. She might be a habitual scoff law who defies authority, or she might have made one tragic mistake in a moment of desperation or anger. Many paths can lead a person to earn a price on his or her head, and not all are undeserved.\n    Outlaw heroes often win the gratitude and loyalty of the poor people in the lands nearby, especially if they&#146;re standing up for commoners against oppressive rulers. In lands where the lawful authorities are weak or corrupt, outlaw heroes might be the only resource for defeating dangerous monsters and putting a stop to villainous plots. In addition, some officials and nobles deliberately cultivate contacts with capable outlaws. Sometimes it&#146;s useful to hire agents to do illegal things for good reasons . . . or for selfish ones. Ambitious nobles or courtiers often find employment for criminals and have ways to protect them from arrest or set them free again if they prove useful. Friends at court can make life much more comfortable for outlaw heroes.\n\n{b}Outlaw Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the surprise strike power.\n{b}Outlaw Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} Choose a terrain type: desert, forest, hills and mountains, marsh and swamp, or snow and tundra. In your chosen terrain, you can&#146;t be tracked and you ignore difficult terrain.\n{b}Outlaw Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Intimidate checks and Streetwise checks." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thPackOut" name="Pack Outcast" description="{i}The true predator kills only what it needs. It is not I who have betrayed our ways.{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Human or shifter\n\nFor your whole life, you&#146;ve been one with the pack. Not all members of the Gray Wolf tribe manifest the beast within in the same way, but you all share it to one extent or another, feeling it bind you in ways few other people can comprehend. You are warriors among your humanoid kin, predators among the beasts of the woodland. You move as one, you live as one, you hunt as one.\n    Or rather, you did.\n    For uncounted generations, your people have venerated the five spiritual pillars on which Gray Wolf culture is based&#151;tradition, the primal spirits, your god Uthgar, the spirits of your ancestors, and the natural order. It never crossed your mind what might happen if the tribe violated any of those precepts, because such a thing was unthinkable. But in the end, the unthinkable happened.\n    In retrospect, you could see the first hints long before things went truly wrong. The current Gray Wolf leaders are more vicious, more bloodthirsty, than those who came before. The Gray Wolf Uthgardt has always been a violent tribe&#151;you carry the fury of the werewolf, after all. However, where you once killed only for sustenance or in defense of your tribal territories, your folk have become raiders as much as hunters.\n    Gray Wolf hunters began to kill for material gain&#151;even, on dark occasion, for sport. Then that darkness was deepened when the shadowed ones came, claiming to represent ancient Netheril reborn. Through honeyed words and the invocation of ancient and long-forgotten alliances, they enticed your leaders into an insidious pact.\n    The history of your tribe has been passed down through generations as stories told by the fireside, and the tales the Netherese told matched those stories. The Uthgardt did come from the blood of old Netheril. The lycanthropy that makes the Gray Wolf tribe strong originated in descendants of Netheril, when refugees from fallen Gauntlgrym carried the curse into the tribe.\n    Yet these facts alone would not have been enough to form an alliance had not the pack&#146;s leaders hungered for the glory of which the shadowed ones spoke. They said that just as old blood ties could be remembered, so too could the glory of the Uthgardt be revived. Conquest would achieve that glory, and when the Netherese controlled the North, the Gray Wolf tribe would be the masters of everything else.\n    Now, your kin fight, kill, and die in the name of motives and goals not their own. However, though doing so went against everything you&#146;d ever been taught, you are among the few who have refused to take up the darkness of this new path. Your instincts told you it was right to do so, even as the Gray Wolf leaders cast you out. Your tribe called you weak and unworthy, yet you left with your head held high.\n    Indeed, from what you have heard, it&#146;s a good thing you made your stand when you did. Had you waited, your punishment might have been more final than exile. Whispered messages, passed to you by those who feel as you do, suggest that the tribe&#146;s leaders are now willing to slaughter their own&#151;not in proper challenge, but in cold-blooded murder.\n    You have a new purpose now. You must drive the shadows of Netheril from the North, finding a way to purge your tribe of the unsavory influences of that land. Only when you set the tribe on the right path will you win back your place in it.\n    You remain a creature of the pack, however, and you know you cannot realize your purpose alone. You must find new allies&#151;a temporary pack to replace the one you have lost.\n\n{b}Pack Outcast Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the body of the wolf power.\n{b}Pack Outcast Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} If you and one or more allies are adjacent to an enemy, that enemy grants you and those allies combat advantage.\n{b}Pack Outcast Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Athletics checks and Intimidate checks." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="thPrAdept" name="Primordial Adept" description="Most mortals give their devotion to the gods, but other powers that crave worship dwell in the cosmos. A primordial adept is a cultist, a seeker after hidden knowledge, or a member of an esoteric order who turns away from the deities to worship one of the ancient primordials.\n    In some places, adepts are considered to be religious individuals and occupy the same role in society that divine priests do. Like priests, adepts are initiated into their powers; some establish their bond with their patron under the tutelage of a cult or a secret society, participating in ceremonies designed to mark their accession to the organization&#146;s inner circles. Other adepts forge their bond with their patrons by devising their own rituals of binding and command.\n    Some adepts think of themselves less as priests and more as scholars and delvers into the unknown. They seek out the writings of older primordial adepts in hopes of mastering a source of power that most other scholars wouldn&#146;t dare to unearth.\n    All primordial adepts have many of the same goals: the mastery of elemental power, the accumulation of knowledge and lore, and the continuing favor of their inscrutable patrons. An adept becomes an adventurer to explore places of ancient power, recover lost knowledge, and (more rarely) advance the causes and designs of his or her elemental patron.\n\n{b}Primordial Adept Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You have proficiency with rods.

  <thing id="thPrpDrgn" name="Purple Dragon" description="{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Good or lawful good alignment\n\nMany able-bodied men and women of Cormyr have taken the oath of sworn service to the Crown of Cormyr and earned the title of Purple Dragon. Although an exceptional few rise to knighthood and become Purple Dragon Knights, the Purple Dragons are those trained soldiers loyal to Cormyr who are ready to serve in times of war.\n    All loyal citizens are eligible to take the oath of the Purple Dragon when they reach maturity. Those of noble lineage are expected to take the oath and typically are trained for positions of leadership, while those of a common bloodline sign up for two years of service in the militia and undergo extensive training.\n    A lucky few are accepted as squires to Purple Dragon Knights. A squire&#146;s crest is emblazoned on a background of the liege&#146;s color, and these backgrounds are as numerous as the shades of the rainbow, though the purple dragon crest is never displayed on a black field. Those in direct service to the royal family and those who do not serve a particular noble bear their crests on a white background. Purple Dragons&#146; training consists of three schools of focus. The young and fearless begin their study by learning attack techniques that bring the fight to the enemy. Those who dream of advancing through the ranks to take positions of leadership study tactics to best take advantage of the battlefield. The most respected are those who train to protect key personnel, especially War Wizards, and do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves for the greater cause. Regardless of role, the Purple Dragons train to fight together as a unit. Loyalty, duty, and honor are valued above all else, and a unit of Purple Dragons can operate as a single machine, utilizing the strengths of the working whole over the individual weaknesses of each component.\n    Purple Dragons spend six months in extensive training. They are then assigned to a specific location to continue training while on active duty. Some receive assignments to serve in a major city and maintain the king&#146;s law; the largest such garrisons are in Suzail and Marsember. Others maintain border patrols as a first line of defense against Cormyr&#146;s enemies. After two years of service, some Purple Dragons choose the defense of Cormyr and enforcement of her laws as a career, but most return to their homes and professions until the need arises for them to bear arms in the name of the king. A rare few become adventurers, honing their skills so that they can be at their best when they are called back into service.\n\n{b}Purple Dragon Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the focused discipline power.\n{b}Purple Dragon Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} When you use the aid another action and succeed, you grant an additional +1 bonus to the aided check.\n{b}Purple Dragon Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} Once per encounter, when you use focused discipline, you can choose a second benefit at the start of one of your turns.

  <thing id="thRRWiz" name="Renegade Red Wizard" description="{i}You will never understand horror until you&#146;ve inflicted it. I understand it. I pray you never do.{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Wizard (mage)\nThay is a nation dedicated to magic and death&#151;a land where undead are not only common, they hold great power. The regent Szass Tam and his Council of Zulkirs&#151;liches all&#151;rule this warring, slaving nation with fists of bone and iron. Those who have grown up under this regime find life in Thay entirely normal&#151;fearsome, perhaps, but not at all unnatural. Those who have the proper magical skills and mindset can even carve out their own place within the necromantic order.\n    You were such a wizard&#151;destined for greatness because of your magical potential. To your family&#146;s great honor, you joined the prestigious academies used to train mages for the ever-growing ranks of the Red Wizards of Thay. There, you were taught the fundamentals of magic in all its schools and forms, but your focus was necromancy.\n    At the time, this dedication seemed normal to you. Manipulating the forces of death itself? Animating those who had been living, breathing, laughing people into mindless, shambling slaves? This is the order of things in Thay&#151;and will be the order across the rest of Faer&#251;n if the regent has his way.\n    So might your life have gone, had not your best friend&#151;a partner and companion throughout your years of schooling&#151;failed an assigned experiment. It was nothing disastrous, only a ritual that went ever so slightly awry, but the event sent your instructor into a rage. When that rage was spent, your friend was dead, his life force sundered by necrotic energy.\n    He was also your next project, for his was the body that the class&#151;working together to perform magic none of you could handle alone&#151;was ordered to reanimate. And you complied, for fear of what might happen if you did not.\n    For the first time, the grotesque, decaying face before you was not that of a stranger. For the first time, you knew of and could feel the utter absence of the life and laughter that once had thrived behind those eyes.\n    You finally understood the horror of what you had been trained to do, and in that moment you forswore necromancy&#151;and Thay itself.\n    It wasn&#146;t that hard to flee, for who would ever try to escape the academies&#151;one of the only ways to gain real power in Szass Tam&#146;s Thay? By the time they knew to look for you, you were already gone.\n    You can barely remember the exhausting, starving months of travel, constantly watching over your shoulder. When you came to the Sword Coast, you realized you had literally fled as far as you could go. Only then did it occur to you to stop running and try to determine what the future might hold.\n    In time, you wandered north to Neverwinter, a place where most of the population was struggling to build new lives. A place where you thought you might fit in. However, it didn&#146;t take you long to hear whispered rumors of a darkness in the North&#151;rumors that dashed all hope of leaving your past behind.\n    The Thayans are here, conducting their foul experiments and stealing people away in the night. How many Neverwintans have joined the ranks of Thay&#146;s slaves after death? How often are more living, laughing faces taking on the foul grin of the undead?\n    It never crossed your mind to run again. You don&#146;t know what the Thayans are doing in the North, but you know that their efforts here can be stopped. They can be defeated. You can protect your new home from what you once were.\n\n    {b}Renegade Red Wizard Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} If you are hidden when you use an arcane attack power and miss every target, you do not automatically become visible (though the targets are entitled to new Perception checks to see if they notice you).\n    {b}Renegade Red Wizard Level 4 Feature (4th level):{/b} You do not gain the Apprentice Mage feature normally gained by a mage at 4th level.

Instead, you gain a +2 bonus to Bluff checks and Intimidate checks.\n    {b}Renegade Red Wizard Level 10 Feature (10th level):{b} You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against any Red Wizard or undead creature that grants combat advantage to you." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thSamurai" name="Samurai" description="Samurai are the elite warriors of the nations of Kozakura and Wa, trained since childhood in the arts of battle. Sworn in service to the powerful nobles who govern the empire, they are expected to live and die according to their master&#146;s command. Cultured and refined, samurai dedicate themselves utterly to the tenets of bushido&#151;the warrior&#146;s code that teaches that one&#146;s life is not one&#146;s own, and that nothing is more important than honor, obedience, and courage.\n    Samurai are born into their class, enjoying social privileges second only to the ruling nobility. Many come from families that own land themselves, and thus grow up accustomed to a life of wealth and entitlement. The samurai&#146;s lofty place in society sometimes leads individuals down a path of arrogance or brutality, since a samurai is above the law when dealing with those of lower station; however, true followers of bushido emphasize traits such as benevolence and politeness, as well as courage.\n    A samurai&#146;s training begins at a young age, when he is introduced to the rigorous demands of bushido. Young samurai are exposed to extreme heat, cold, and pain, enduring all with emotionless poise. They are steeled against the fear of death by being sent on errands through graveyards or near hangman&#146;s gallows at night. Each samurai-in-training is taught to read and write, contemplating classics of literature, religion, and art with which to refine his mind and spirit. Finally, all are taught the martial arts for which these warriors are most well known.\n    Samurai heroes are expected to fight and die at their lord&#146;s command, and their adventures reflect that. Samurai will undertake any quest their master assigns them, whether waging open war or avenging an insult to their lord&#146;s honor; a samurai obeys without hesitation. A samurai who proves worthy of reward will be honored with lands and wealth, and, perhaps most important, the lord&#146;s approval. This honor, and the perpetual striving toward one&#146;s perfection of bushido, is all-important for a samurai, who will go to any length to maintain and uphold it. Should a samurai bring shame to himself or his master, he is allowed to take his own life in an act of ritualistic suicide, allowing him to die with his honor intact. For a samurai, death is preferable to dishonor.\n\n{b}Samurai Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the iaijutsu power.\n\n{b}Samurai Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks.\n\n{b}Samurai Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} Choose a weapon group when you gain this feature. When you make a weapon attack with a weapon from that group and score a critical hit, the attack deals 1d6 extra damage to the target. This increases to 2d6 extra damage at level 21." compset="Theme">

Threats to the kingdom are manifold, and the High Lady demands much of her champions. Only when it is time for Sarifal to retreat once more beyond the twilight veil can a feywarden relax his vigil. Heed the principles of your noble eladrin matriarch, and you might earn the High Lady&#146;s appreciation.\n    You are never completely at ease beyond the wilderness. Most feywardens run in a loosely organized party with the eldest serving as the leader. Rare individuals, such as yourself, are sent beyond the verdant confines of Sarifal to gather intelligence on the kingdom&#146;s enemies.\n    Feywardens are guardians of Sarifal and all things that dwell there. Your principal enemies are denizens of the Feydark who seek to despoil the pristine lands under your protection. You distrust humankind, seeing their attempts to tame and clear the wilderness as wasteful. You have a deep reverence for the primal spirits that watch over the Moonshaes, the Earthmother in particular.\n    Outsiders regard feywardens as curiously introverted and evasive. Most feywardens are unaligned or good. Few fey realms are subject to the same sort of dagger-in-the-back power struggles that often erupt in human kingdoms, but agents of the Unseelie fey are ever watchful for opportunities to lure feywardens into temptation and ruin.\n\n{b}Sarifal Feywarden Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the Sarifal&#146;s blessing power.\n{b}Sarifal Feywarden Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Nature checks.

  <thing id="thSchlr" name="Scholar" description="For some, the past is dead and buried, but any adventurer who has ever set foot in a trap-filled, ancient tomb or battled a terrible demon freed from some centuries-old binding knows that what happened long ago might be of crucial importance to those living in the present day. Scholars study the lore of ancient times, collecting old texts and ferreting out forgotten secrets. They seek to preserve the memories of bygone days and pass along to future generations the important lessons the past offers. As with any dungeon-delving adventurers, they are keenly interested in dormant perils and lost treasures, but scholars are just as interested in the most ordinary details of ancient realms and events. To scholars, knowledge is its own reward.\n    Not all cultures or societies value the musty old tales of ancient days. For many people, the study of history&#151;or simple literacy&#151;is an extravagance. Scholars are highly specialized professionals, and their services are not in great demand. The typical frontier town or farming village has no library or formal schooling. As a result, scholars are found only in places where books and records are collected. Large cities sometimes feature vaults or libraries dedicated to scholarship, and they might have colleges or guilds of scholars who study in them. However, large collections of books are more typically the prized possessions of temples dedicated to deities of knowledge and civilization (such as Ioun or Erathis), or of powerful noble families. Most scholars are therefore sponsored or supported by a temple or patron, and they seek to repay their benefactors by adding to their collections throughout their careers.\n\n{b}Scholar Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You know one additional language chosen from Draconic, Dwarven, and Elven. In addition, you gain the use vulnerability power.\n{b}Scholar Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} Choose training in one new skill and one new language. The skill you choose must be Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Nature, or Religion; if you already have training in all of these skills, you instead gain a +2 bonus to skill checks with one of those skills. The language you choose must be Draconic, Dwarven, or Elven; if you already know all three, choose one language from those listed in the Rules Compendium (page 69) or Player&apos;s Handbook (page 25).\n{b}Scholar Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You know all the languages listed in the Rules Compendium (page 69) and Player&apos;s Handbook (page 25). (At the Dungeon Master&#146;s discretion, other languages can be added to the languages you know with this feature.)

  <thing id="thScnShdw" name="Scion of Shadow" description="Toril thrives in the light. I&#146;ll have no part in dragging it down into darkness.\nPrerequisite: Human, shadar-kai, or shade\n\nMore than a century has passed since the Year of Wild Magic and the return of Thultanthar, the City of Shade, to the skies of Faer&#251;n. This last bastion of ancient Netheril had survived for over a millennium in the depths of the Shadowfell, where the raw essence of shadow has long intertwined with the souls of the Shadovar. Some have become shades; some are born shadar-kai. Most are still human, but with an element of darkness about them.\n    You were born into the nobility of the Shadovar&#151;not at any great rank, but high enough to ensure yourself a position of power in the restored empire. Like all Shadovar, you were raised to believe in Netherese supremacy&#151;bombarded constantly with the knowledge that dominance was your people&#146;s birthright, that the other peoples of Toril were weak and inferior, and that Netheril would rule once more.\n    You had no reason not to believe in your great destiny. At least, not at first. However, as your education progressed, you were sent out into the world to observe Netherese military actions. Serving the overseers of &#147;reclaimed&#148; communities, you would occasionally skirmish with the border patrols of neighboring nations. For reasons you still do not fully understand, something in the world beyond Shade Enclave spoke to you as your home never had.\n    You stood in the light of the sun, untouched by the lingering darkness of the Shadowfell, and felt its burn not as painful but as cleansing. You observed the &#147;weak and worthless&#148; folk beyond Netheril and perceived a simple joy for life that you could never imagine seeing within the Shadovar. You knew instantly that this was the life you wanted&#151;one far from the machinations, tyranny, and darkness of your home.\n    You had to pull some strings and con your family into pulling others. However, in the end, it wasn&#146;t hard to have yourself assigned to the ongoing Netherese efforts in Neverwinter Wood, hunting for old ruins and ancient magic. Your hope was that this Shadovar endeavor farthest from Netheril would provide you the opportunity to disappear before you were missed.\n    It worked, in part. You were able to slip away between expeditions into the woods and make your way to Neverwinter. So far, you&#146;ve managed to keep your past a secret, seeming to be just one of the many people trying to make a fresh start in a slowly recovering city.\n    Yet something eats at you as you try to start your new life. Your people have not come to the North just to dig up the detritus of old empires. The magic they find here is meant to be put to a purpose. You don&#146;t know what that purpose might be, but before you left Netheril, you heard whispered rumors that spoke of raising an enclave.\n    It&#146;s a crazy idea. The magic to perform such a mighty ritual hasn&#146;t existed since the fall of Netheril over a thousand years ago. Certainly, other enclaves have been launched into the air since the Year of Wild Magic, but these were existing structures. The powerful magic of the mythallars that allows such structures to take to the skies was already extant, only needing repair. Surely nothing like that could be found anywhere near Neverwinter . . . or could it?\n    You came to Neverwinter to flee, but more and more, you wonder if you could ever have run far enough. If you remain here, you know you won&#146;t be able to hide forever. If the Netherese succeed in their plans for the region, a new Shadovar stronghold might arise here&#151;one possibly as mighty as Shade Enclave. If that happens, you would find yourself in the shadow of Netheril once again. Much as you&#146;d like to simply vanish into the darkness, the dark is where your people are most dangerous. And that means your only option is to face them here.\n\n{b}Scion of Shadow Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the eyes of night power.\n{b}Scion of Shadow Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} Whenever you are in dim light or darkness, add 4 to your healing surge value.\n{b}Scion of Shadow Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Stealth checks." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thSctApst" name="Secret Apostate" description="{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Drow. All secret apostates are drow who have turned against Lolth.\n\nSome Menzoberranzan drow yearn for a life free from the tyranny of the Spider Queen. These apostate drow have renounced the teachings of Lolth and embraced a philosophy based on individuality and free will. Existence for these secret apostates is dangerous, because they live in constant fear of discovery by Lolth&#146;s many spies. If their true nature is discovered, they face certain torture and death.\n    A secret apostate values freedom and choice, and each pursues personal goals independent of those dictated by other members of drow society or its dark mistress. By no stretch of the imagination does this imply most secret apostates are noble or good; they remain just as selfish and avaricious as other drow. They believe that their aspirations and desires trump those of an overbearing and controlling theocracy.\n    After renouncing Lolth, a secret apostate usually travels one of two paths. Some develop such a strong hatred for their own society that they actively work to undermine and destroy it. Specializing in elaborate schemes and intrigues, such an apostate might foment a slave rebellion or create conflict between two houses by assassinating a high-ranking official of one house and framing the other for the deed.\n    Other secret apostates become loners, seeking to avoid others of their kind and to forge their own destinies. One might travel to the surface world, only to wander through foreign lands inhabited by those who distrust or wish to destroy the drow.\n    Regardless of the path taken, a secret apostate loathes other drow as much as any surface-dweller and does not hesitate to kill members of his or her race if the occasion demands it.\n    For those who follow the arduous and lonely road of the secret apostate, it is better to risk torture and death as a free drow than to endure an existence of servitude. Let the weak-willed sheep bind themselves to the Spider Queen. A secret apostate lives a life unfettered, or dies trying.\n\n{b}Secret Apostate Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the apostate&#146;s freedom power.\n{b}Secret Apostate Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Stealth checks.\n{b}Secret Apostate Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} When a creature makes a charm attack against you, it must roll twice and use the lower result.

  <thing id="thSkrIll" name="Seeker of Illefarn" description="{i}Bad enough, in such tumultuous times, that our future might be in doubt. I will not permit our past to be stolen away as well.{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Eladrin, elf, or half-elf\n\nYou grew to adulthood in the shade of Ardeep Forest among a small community of elves, not far from the bustling metropolis of Waterdeep. You were raised on legends, tales, and songs of the kingdom of Ardeep and the great elven empire of Illefarn before it.\n    In ancient days, elves ruled a great empire in the North called Illefarn. This empire fractured when the last Coronal of the elves led the retreat to Evermeet. Illefarn split into the nations of Ardeep, Iliyanbruen, and Rilitha. These kingdoms each fell in turn over the centuries, with the last of the elves leaving Ardeep for Evermeet over a century ago.\n    Your parents and others moved into the Ardeep Forest to try to reclaim and relive something of Ardeep&#146;s former glory. But little remains of that lost civilization. As the seasons passed into years, you dreamed of glorious days when your people ruled the region in peace and fairness. You imagined ancient Aelinthaldaar, the capital of Illefarn, rising tall where Waterdeep stands now. You mourned the loss of that nation as though it happened recently, not gone from the world for over two thousand years. Illefarn fell not to the hostile orcs and other enemies that sought to destroy it, but to humans and dwarves and allied races whose growing presence squeezed the elves until the Coronal felt there was no room left for the culture that had thrived in the region since before the Crown Wars.\n    In your youth, you returned time and again to a glade dedicated to Corellon&#151;not to pray, but to gaze in awe upon relics of lost Illefarn, including a single, cracked arrow said to have been launched from the bow of the empire&#146;s last Coronal, Syglaeth Audark.\n    But these were mere daydreams and empty wishes, and not part of your daily life until a few months ago, when several of your town&#146;s hunters returned with the body of an eladrin found dead near the Crypts of the Deepening Moon. Your people know well enough to avoid those tombs of Ardeep because of the creatures that guard them. Yet the fallen eladrin did not appear to be a typical tomb robber: the quality of her clothes and possessions indicated someone of higher rank, akin to a diplomat. But the style of her possessions more resembled the old fashions you&#146;d seen on the statues and carvings of the ruins of Illefarn.\n    The town assembled a party of hunters and warriors to follow the eladrin&#146;s trail and learn where she came from, and you, having recently proven your skills in such matters, went along. Tracking the eladrin was hard but not impossible, with the trail eventually leading to Waterdeep. However, finding anyone who remembered the eladrin in such an enormous place proved more difficult than tracking her week-old trail through the forest, and many of your fellows abandoned the quest. But you pushed on. Something about the mystery drove you.\n    You finally met a group of moon elves that had seen the eladrin. They said she was secretive and spoke with a strange accent. She said she sought Ardeep, and the elves had assumed she meant Ardeep Forest. Apparently she had come from Neverwinter by ship. Why had she traveled to Ardeep Forest all the way from Neverwinter? Why the strange accent and clothes? Where did she come from&#151;out of the distant past? It could be that the Neverwinter Woods, once the bastion of Iliyanbruen and a part of ancient Illefarn, holds the answers.\n    Perhaps it was fate, or an omen from the gods, that this should happen now, when you are old enough to choose your own way and skilled enough to make a difference. In the mysterious depths of the Neverwinter Woods and its surroundings, you can seek out other lost remnants of ancient Illefarn. You must locate them, and reclaim their wonders, their knowledge, and their treasures for the elves, to whom they rightfully belong. You must safeguard your heritage from those who would desecrate it for personal gain. And if you can, you must uncover the truth about the mysterious eladrin.\n\n{b}Seeker of Illefarn Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} Once per encounter when you roll a 1 on an attack roll or a saving throw, roll again, and use the second result.\n{b}Seeker of Illefarn Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Perception checks.\n{b}Seeker of Illefarn Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} While you are conscious, you cannot be surprised.

  <thing id="thSeer" name="Seer" description="Gifted with unusual abilities to perceive things hidden by distance or uncertainty, seers are prized as advisors by powerful people throughout the world. They might call themselves astrologers, fortunetellers, readers, augurs, diviners, or soothsayers, and each employs a favored technique for prognostication. Many seers choose to complicate their viewings with flamboyant mummery designed to impress ordinary people and perhaps conceal the important secrets of their trade. But despite the confusing mystical trappings, seers aren&#146;t frauds. Their second sight is a real and powerful gift, even if it is fickle at times.\n    The ability to anticipate success or failure in great endeavors, to determine the most auspicious times to embark on risky ventures, or to read the secret motives of others is a valuable edge. Naturally, wealthy patrons seek out famous and successful seers so that they can gain advantage over their rivals. Retained as permanent advisors and paid generously for their services, these kept seers are at the top of their profession. Kept seers enjoy unusual access to those they serve, and they can become entangled in the petty rivalries and battles for influence that pervade most courts and noble households. To minimize such entanglements, some rulers choose to sequester their magical advisors, keeping them out of the reach of courtiers or rivals who might harbor ambitious schemes. Other seers embrace their role as important figures in the court. Competent seers with this sort of position are placed well to do great good, but they can also do serious harm if they provide their masters with inept advice or engage in disloyal behavior. After all, a &#147;trusted&#148; wizard has deposed more than one king.\n    Seers who have not yet attracted a wealthy patron or established a reputation for success settle for a meager living catering to commoners, casting fortunes for a few coppers or silvers at a turn. Ordinary people often seek the advice of augurs and diviners when contemplating major business decisions, choosing a time to travel, arranging marriages, naming a child, or seeking explanations for some sort of misfortune. In a bustling city, well-respected seers with a wealthy clientele can make a comfortable living. Seers from small or backward towns might be little better than peddlers and beggars, hard-pressed to feed themselves from day to day&#151;a situation that makes it hard to convince potential customers that one&#146;s powers offer useful insights. Adventuring seers fall somewhere between the extremes of royal advisor or marketplace fortune-teller; they rarely settle down in the service of a single patron, but in time their spreading fame ensures that many will come to seek their advice.\n\n{b}Seer Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the cast fortune power.\n{b}Seer Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Insight checks.\n{b}Seer Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} Whenever you make a Perception check, you can roll twice and use either result." compset="Theme">

For some members, these characterizations are true. More dedicated Sensates understand that the only way to truly experience life is to seek out variety in all things. Although tasting exotic food and drink is important, it&#146;s just as important to understand what it&#146;s like to go without even basic sustenance to experience the feeling of deprivation.\n    Sensates seek this balance. The faction teaches that the only way to discover the purpose of the multiverse is to experience as many sensations, colors, textures, impulses, feelings, smells, and sensory inputs as possible. Only when every possible moment is experienced will the truth become clear; a composite understanding of existence will crystallize to those who have sought out and processed it all.\n    A lofty goal, for sure, which is why the Society believes that no one has managed it yet. Still, it&#146;s hard to argue with the benefits of seeking out new experiences, especially for adventurers and explorers.

  <thing id="thSnMshl" name="Sentinel Marshal" description="Sentinel Marshals undertake many types of missions and have many reasons to travel. They receive assignments within Deneith enclaves throughout Khorvaire and sometimes beyond, such as in the house&#146;s Stormreach enclave. Between missions, a Marshal&#146;s time is her own. She can travel with allies provided that she checks in at Deneith outposts whenever possible.\n    In times of crisis, Sentinel Marshals have the power to deputize worthy allies&#151;especially other warriors or other members of House Deneith&#151;to assist them. This title does not grant allies the full authority of a Sentinel Marshal, but it legitimizes their presence and recognizes their aid if the mission is later scrutinized. Depending on the circumstances, a Marshal&#146;s allies might be debriefed afterward, rewarded for their efforts, and asked to help again.\n    A typical assignment for a Sentinel Marshal is to find (and kill, if necessary) a known and dangerous criminal. Such criminals are usually of the worst sort&#151;the ones who leave town, consort with unsavory fellow outlaws, make fiendish alliances, and don&#146;t play fair.\n    Sentinel Marshals are also special operatives, not just law officers. One might be asked to assist in a diplomatic mission to Droaam, seize a shipment of Xen&#146;drik relics from pirates on the Thunder Sea, or save an Eldeen village from a dragon roused by the Lords of Dust.\n    The missions assigned to you, as an adventuring Marshal, are suitable for your skills and those of your known associates and regular deputies. If you are a rogue, you might be ordered to infiltrate a thieves&#146; guild and slay the vampire lord that rules it. If you are a fighter, you might be sent to defeat an ettin terrorizing Breland&#146;s western borders.\n    You&#146;re not always on duty, so you can go on adventures that have nothing do with your house. Nor are you required to chase down a cutpurse in the streets or arrest a merchant you see committing fraud unless you&#146;ve been hired to do so. Yet you retain the right to enact justice whenever you deem it necessary. Some Marshals are callous about their authority, enforcing the law only in certain cases or when they&#146;re required to do so. Others cannot stand idle when they witness even the pettiest crimes. It&#146;s up to you to decide where you fall on the spectrum of justice.\n    Remember that you don&#146;t have to kill every foe. Sometimes you&#146;re the good guy who drags the bad guys back to the city to face the music. But just as often, you need to be the judge, jury, and executioner who gets the job done by any means necessary. Usually, a fugitive&#146;s head is proof enough that he&#146;s no longer a threat.\n\n{b}Sentinel Marshal Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks when the check&#146;s subject knows that you are a Sentinel Marshal and respects or fears members of that group.

  <thing id="thSdhLrd" name="Sidhe Lord" description="{i}&quot;The archfey might seem the most powerful, but the real masters of the people are the Sidhe lords such as I.&quot;{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Half-elf, or any race that has the fey origin.\n\nAmong the fey races, particularly elves and eladrin, powerful noble houses have arisen over the years as the authority in the Feywild. The various fey courts, including the Summer Queen&#146;s Court of Stars, are made up of representatives from these houses. Although the houses vary in makeup, goals, and methods, their members are collectively known as Sidhe lords&#151;a title that paints them all with the same brush.\n    The first true Sidhe lords were elves who lived before the great conflict that splintered the race into three factions. In the days when the race was in its youth, some ambitious elves claimed dominion over the untamed Feywild. When none could challenge them, these early Sidhe lords established themselves as pillars of power in the realm, and an order was born among the fey races. The common people showed deference to the Sidhe lords, and the lords protected those within their dominion.\n    Later, as the people of the Feywild matured and the elf race split into elves, eladrin, and drow, a greater variety of Sidhe lords rose to prominence. Most of these were individuals of other races, such as drow and satyrs, who had gained influence and forged alliances. Rather than engaging in power struggles that could weaken their houses, the established lords acknowledged the new self-proclaimed nobles, giving them legitimacy. To this day, most of the Sidhe lords of the Feywild are eladrin (many of the elf lords took their power bases with them into the natural world), but the newer noble houses have offspring of other races.\n    The noble houses of the Sidhe lords behave much as their counterparts do in the mortal world; they work together, come into conflict with one another, plot and manipulate, and meddle in the affairs of common people. The fey houses typically choose colors and heraldry the same way that human nobles do, but their symbols are fey creatures such as displacer beasts and owlbears.\n    Most Sidhe lords are eager to associate themselves with dominion over an aspect of the Feywild. The Prince of Frost, for example, claims sovereignty over the Vale of Long Night, and he is known as the Sidhe lord who commands winter (at least, within the Feywild). Other Sidhe lords might hold sway over specific kinds of fey creatures (for example, displacer beasts).\n    Formidable fey nobles make bargains with weaker beings or with those they favor. Sidhe lords have amassed a great deal of influence and arcane might, and a formal pact establishes a bond that allows a lord to transfer that power to a recipient.

  <thing id="thSklVrn" name="Skulker of Vhaeraun" description="{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Drow.\nThe power of the priestesses of Lolth in Menzoberranzan is almost absolute, but some residents worship the patron god of male drow, Vhaeraun. Primarily spies, assassins, and thieves, adherents of Vhaeraun slip stealthily through the shadows of the city on missions for the Masked God of Night. Open worship of Vhaeraun is forbidden, so his followers must conceal their allegiance. Many cannot endure the constant fear of capture and flee to the surface world.\n    Almost all skulkers of Vhaeraun are disenfranchised male drow who are disappointed by their lack of authority and power in Menzoberranzan&#146;s matriarchal society. Although some have renounced the evil ways of their people, many Vhaeraun worshipers remain true to drow nature, and they readily lie, steal, and betray if it serves their needs.\n    A skulker of Vhaeraun excels at getting into and out of hostile areas unnoticed. Consider an assassin who infiltrates a noble manse to slay its occupants with poisonous blades. Imagine a thief slipping into a temple of Lolth to steal a priceless treasure or cutting a dangling purse from an easy mark in a city street. Picture an accomplished spy, who might pose as a consort to a loyal priestess to glean information from her, or who might accept employ in a rival house&#146;s guard to overhear secrets. Each of these individuals might worship the Masked Lord.\n    Poison is the favored weapon of Vhaeraun&#146;s servants. A skulker excels in its use, coating his blades and arrows with drow sleep poison or other exotic poisons such as black lotus extract or spotted toadstool venom. The Masked Lord&#146;s followers delight in discovering new poisons and pay handsomely to acquire them.\n\n{b}Skulker of Vhaeraun Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the skulker&#146;s venom power.\n{b}Skulker of Vhaeraun Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Acrobatics checks and Stealth checks.\n{b}Skulker of Vhaeraun Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} When you deal poison damage to a creature, it takes a -2 penalty to the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

  <thing id="thSohei" name="Sohei" description="In Kara-Tur, as in the West, grand shrines can be found in the teeming cities. However, those seeking a quicker path to enlightenment or total devotion to the gods prefer remote monasteries or temples. Such places of worship offer immersion in spiritual pursuits and isolation from the distractions of civilization. Most are hidden high in remote hills or mountains, making the very act of finding the place a show of one&#146;s dedication to the sacred.\n    An urban shrine&#146;s clergy can look to the local authorities for protection from monsters, bandits, and enemies of the faith. A wilderness temple&#146;s devotees cannot&#151;most secluded places of worship are as much fortress as monastery. Just as such a holy place needs walls, it also needs guardians who share the spiritual values of their less militant fellows.\n    A sohei, sometimes called a yamabushi (&#147;mountain warrior&#148;) due to the usual site of farflung monasteries and shrines, is a monastic soldier trained as a temple guardian. Rather than focusing on intense religious instruction, a sohei receives training in meditation, body control, and martial techniques. Although devoted clergy of the same religion or sect might practice pacifism, a sohei warrior-monk does not.\n    The difference between a sohei and a fellow priest is type of duty. The warrior-monk looks out for the safety of the temple, allowing other priests to fulfill duties that are more spiritual. A sohei can also serve as the face of a religious order, going out into the world to spread the faith, strike against the temple&#146;s enemies, and seek objects and people important to the religion.\n    A sohei&#146;s superiors are figures higher in his or her religious hierarchy. Every sohei is a devoted combatant with mastery over preferred weapons, and each serves those higher in the hierarchy with obedience. As part of their service to the religion, they also learn to wield magical power. Often divine in nature, this power is a blessing of the sohei&#146;s commitment to a deity. However, legendary sohei&#151;even those from the same religious sect&#151;wield varying mystical capabilities.\n    A sohei can come from any walk of life. Children given into the service of a temple, whether orphans or nobles, can become sohei. Older initiates might be anything from outlaws to ronin. Requirements for becoming a militant priest include strength and willpower, as well as an abundance of energy and ambition that compels the individual to abandon the wholly meditative life.\n    An adventuring sohei frequently takes on a quest for his or her religious order. A few sohei go into the world to experience its mysteries, using worldly knowledge as part of a path to enlightenment. Other sohei, such as ronin, have been expelled from or have lost their temples. These wanderers search for a new purpose as much as any ronin does." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

This is our city, and we shall reclaim it any way we can.\nYou grew up on the mean streets of ruined Neverwinter, long after the Spellplague reduced the city to smoldering rubble. You learned the laws of this new world the hard way, and watched first-hand as the struggle to survive shattered families, stole livelihoods, and destroyed lives. As long as you can remember, you have suffered from the bizarre nightmares that are part of life in the broken city.\n    As bad as it gets, nothing has chased you away from your home. You are a child of Neverwinter, and while the city still stands, you refuse to kneel.\n    A few years ago, when Dagult Neverember, a lord of Waterdeep, arrived to stabilize and rebuild the city, you saw right through him. To you, he is not a savior but an invader&#151;his army of &#147;peacekeepers&#148; an occupation force. You might have regarded them benignly at first, hoping your doubts would prove unfounded, but Neverember&#146;s goons quickly dashed any illusions you had about their intentions. But most people in the city aren&#146;t privy to your insight, or aren&#146;t willing to listen. You found that all the rhetoric in the world won&#146;t convince the people to rise up and resist the great &#147;Protector,&#148; so you turned to more direct means.\n    You joined the rebel movement known as the Sons of Alagondar, named for the city&#146;s legendary royal family. With the Sons, you found ways to channel your rage, and felt as though in some small ways you have successfully restrained the usurper of your homeland.\n    The rebels have suffered setbacks recently, however. Their charismatic leader, Cymril, was slain less than a month ago, plunging the organization into chaos. Factions have emerged, each of them forging alliances with dark forces in the city. Some operatives of the Sons have made overtures to the brutish Dead Rats gang, while others curry favor with the malevolent Red Wizards in the city. Caught between your principles and the necessity of having potent allies, you aren&#146;t sure who you can trust. What started as a noble and simple fight for freedom has become complicated.\n    You have choices to make, and none of them are good. You dream of yet another solution: the return of a true heir of House Alagondar, who can unite the city against the usurper. But even if a true heir were to appear, would you welcome him with relief or suspicion?\n\n{b}Son of Alagondar Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} While you flank an enemy, your allies gain a +1 power bonus to attack rolls against that enemy.\n    In addition, you gain the low blow power.\n{b}Son of Alagondar Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Stealth checks and Thievery checks.\n{b}Son of Alagondar Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} The first time you are bloodied during an encounter, you gain temporary hit points equal to 2 + one-half your level." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thSpScHr" name="Spellscarred Harbinger" description="{i}I&#146;ve seen horrors you haven&#146;t even dreamed. Whether I sleep or wake, the nightmares follow me.{/i}\nNearly a century ago, Faer&#251;n was ravaged by the Spellplague. Few of those alive today can describe this scourge firsthand, and every story disagrees in the details. Landscapes changed, whole cities vanished, and alien nations installed themselves where barren wasteland and the ruins of past civilizations had stood for millennia. Magic failed or went wild, and thousands upon thousands died horribly. Those who encountered the plague directly, either initially or in the long years since, have been forever changed by its touch. Most are horribly deformed or otherwise cursed&#151;even as a rare few gain a strange kind of power.\n    Someone seeing you as a youth might not have known you were bound to such a twisted destiny. You were a normal person, living out a normal life. You had family and friends, and you were looking forward to marriage and children to carry on your legacy. These simple pleasures were not to be yours, however&#151;not once the nightmares began. You ignored the visions at first, but you could not do so for long.\n    One night, you awoke from a nightmare screaming, engulfed in blue flames that were no dream. Though it did not harm you, this unnatural fire wreaked havoc on everything nearby, consuming your home and those you loved, their screams echoing as they burned. When the flames died away, they left in their wake disfigurements on the bodies of the dead&#151;warped limbs, blue scar tissue, or strange runes in a language you did not recognize. Though you survived the destruction, your body was likewise scarred.\n    Hated for the harm you inflicted unintentionally and despised for your deformity, you fled your home in fear. Dependent on the aid of strangers to survive, you were saved when a wandering priest sworn to Ilmater, god of compassion, directed you to Helm&#146;s Hold outside the city of Neverwinter. There, he promised, people like you were welcome. &#147;The spellscarred,&#148; he called you.\n    During your journey, you have tried to puzzle out the reason for the emergence of your curse, to no certain success. Perhaps you were exposed to the Spellplague long ago, and it then lay dormant in you for years. Some say the curse can be inherited by blood, and so the affliction will lead inevitably to more death&#151;for you and those around you.\n    You fear that your time grows short. Whenever you rest, the nightmares that haunted you before your scarring return, coupled with visions of magical cataclysms wreathed in blue flame. You have grown accustomed to looking over your shoulder at all times, struggling to trust even those who seek to aid you.\n    A time is coming when you&#146;ll be able to conceal your true nature no longer. When that day comes, how will you embrace your uncertain destiny? And can the people in Helm&#146;s Hold truly help you?\n\n{b}Spellscarred Harbinger Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain one of the following abilities.\n     Dimension Shift: Once per encounter, you can teleport up to 2 squares as a minor action.\n     Twist Fate: Once per encounter, you can reroll a failed saving throw.\n     Vanish: Once per encounter as a minor action, you can become invisible until the start of your next turn.\n{b}Spellscarred Harbinger Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain the spellscar empowerment power.\n{b}Spellscarred Harbinger Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} Choose another benefit from the spellscarred harbinger starting feature list.

  <thing id="thStrmrdr" name="Stormraider" description="In the Elemental Chaos, merchants must transport valuable goods between cities in order to make a profit, and where there is trade, there are pirates who stand ready to acquire those goods. Stormraiders are a specialized class of pirates who strike the trade lanes of the Elemental Chaos aboard their fast lightning skiffs.\n    Known for the suddenness and ferocity of their attacks, stormraiders lack any formalized structure. Instead, they have a loose fraternity built around a few common guidelines: &#147;Help a raider crew in need,&#148; &#147;Share in the plunder,&#148; and &#147;Never betray a comrade before the mast&#148; serve as the only laws of stormraider society. Petty disputes are resolved in bloody duels on the deck of a lightning skiff, usually surrounded by a cheering crew betting on the outcome. It is a hard and uncertain life, knowing no home but one&#146;s ship, with no safe port of call. Death can come quickly at the end of a sword, or slowly at the talons of a demon that is tired of losing its treasures to stormraider crews. The only havens known to stormraider ships are a few small pirate ports built on twirling earthmotes, where lighting skiffs can rest their crews, resupply, and repair their vessels. Still, many are willing to fight beneath the thunderhead-black flag of piracy. Escaped slaves from the City of Brass revel in the freedom they find in the stormraider&#146;s life, and pirates from the Riverweb seeking new adventures can readily find it on the deck of a lightning skiff. No matter the background of the individual, the life of a raider is one of constant momentum, quickly transitioning from one adventure to the next.\n    Stormraider heroes regularly command the respect of the crews they serve alongside, often seeming to be marked for greatness. Aboard a lightning skiff commanded by a particularly bloodthirsty captain, these heroes are often the sole voice of reason, able to keep the captain from bouts of wanton and pointless slaughter. It is not unheard of for communities in the Elemental Chaos to hire adventuring stormraiders as privateers, or for lords to employ crews to raid the ships of personal enemies. The Elemental Chaos is full of opportunities, and clever stormraiders stand poised to claim them all.\n\n{b}Stormraider Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the storm the deck power.\n{b}Stormraider Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to initiative checks.

Those innovative souls who dare to actively seek out death&#146;s secrets learn that an entirely new realm of shadow awaits their discovery. Many temples and libraries include tomes on the subject of death. If someone had enough motivation and spent plenty of time researching, he or she could soon learn of the famed shadow mage Evard.\n    Evard, an enigmatic and potent practitioner of shadow magic, is a master of necromancy and nethermancy. His legacy is such that anyone who has spent time researching the Shadowfell has undoubtedly come across his most famous work, Legendry of Phantoms and Ghosts. This 800-page omnibus is one of the finest pieces of writing on the subjects of shadow magic, necromancy, and nethermancy. It covers everything from the creation of apparitions to details on their metaphysical construction and anatomy.\n    Those who learn of Evard and begin to study his work could become enthralled by all things related to the Shadowfell. Some who study Evard&#146;s works become recluses; others might seek to adventure in an effort to learn more of the Shadowfell and its inhabitants. On a research level, those seeking knowledge on these topics try to understand the breaching of the two planes of existence and learn how both sides interact with each other. As Evard noted, &#147;You can never come to appreciate the fabric and essence of life without first knowing in full detail the beauty of death.&#148;\n\n{b}Student of Evard Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the essence of death power.\n{b}Student of Evard Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to skill checks involving necromancy, nethermancy, and the Shadowfell.

Treasure hunters also enjoy the thrill of the chase when seeking out valuable finds, sometimes to the point of addiction, and this adventurous spirit can be contagious.\n    Finding lost or buried treasure is much harder than it appears at first. Treasure hunters constantly crave more wealth.

Some, though, learn to love the unique history of the antiquities they seek. Those without a formal education might study a subject related to their quest on their own, even becoming specialists on specific topics.\n    Treasure hunters are typically self-sufficient. Occasionally several work together to meet similar goals, but they do not trust each other.

  <thing id="thTuathan" name="Tuathan" description="{i}&quot;There&#146;s a reason why I always watch what I say when animals are around.&quot;{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Human or half-elf.\n\nLegend tells of a great tribe of humans that settled the world in antiquity. Some say these humans were shapeshifters, born of primal spirits or fey creatures; others say they were the warlike children of a fey goddess. With valor and magic untold, they came from the Feywild in great vessels with sails like white wings. Wielding items of vast power, they conquered all opposing tribes (commingling with some of the elves they subjugated), carved out a realm, and ruled it for centuries. Eventually they fell into decline. The great race receded, its empire crumbled, and it withdrew into the Feywild, leaving behind fragments of glorious epics, hidden troves of magic, and the name of the mighty tribe: Tuatha. &#147;The tribe&#148;&#151;for that is what the word meant in ancient Elven-dispersed throughout the land of the fey, where it is said its descendants remain to this day.\n    Nowadays, any human or half-elf born or blessed with a strain of fey magic might be a tuathan. Most tuathans are born in the Feywild, and the bold vibrancy of that realm courses through their veins as it did in the tribe of old. Tuathans born in the mortal world are the result of brief human trysts with beautiful faerie folk. Such children are usually raised by the mortal parent in the natural world, and they grow up with little idea of their enchanted heritage. Deep in their hearts, however, they yearn to strike out into the unknown.\n    Tuathans are compelled to experience more wondrous adventures than have ever been told in tales. Perhaps this urge is what drove the conquering Tuatha from the Feywild in ancient times, and perhaps it is the reason the tribe returned to the fey realm after ruling for so long. When tuathans set their sights on a distant horizon, a love to be won, or a challenge to be met, fulfilling the goal occupies their thoughts as intensely as the pangs of first love. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most fairy tales that migrate to the mortal world are stories of the tuathans of the Feywild striving to attain their heart&#146;s desire.\n    Some tuathans bear no outward mark of their fey heritage and appear as ordinary humans or halfelves in every aspect. Most appear as slender, exotic individuals with striking, well-defined features and thick, lustrous hair. Their most remarkable physical characteristics are the slight suggestions of fey or animal traits that delicately grace their faces, notably eyes, noses, hair, and ears. Some have eyes like those of cats, eladrin, or owls; others have shining manes of dark hair naturally interwoven with raven, peacock, or eagle feathers; still others have subtly elongated noses or ears suggestive of foxes, cats, or elves. These understated traits appear natural and are rarely noticed at a glance.\n    A few tuathans are fey shapechangers, able to transform into the beasts or birds that their normal features suggest. In ancient tales, shapechangers served tuathan kings and queens as explorers, spies, and court magic users. Today, such individuals travel the Feywild as trader nomads. They visit villages, towns, and cities of the natural world to give mortals a spark of magic in their lives&#151;but always for a price.\n    A vow or a bargain made with a tuathan is binding and cannot be broken without consequences, which are often magical. Tuathans believe that powerful enchantments are inherent in spoken stories, vows, bargains, rhymes, names, songs, and chants. For a tuathan, to say a thing is to give it life, to make it real.\n    Tuathans believe that nothing in the world is unobtainable, and when they accept a challenge, they seldom back down from it. They pursue their aims to the ends of the world, for it is by the magnitude of their deeds that they will be remembered in song and story through the ages, like the Tuatha of old.\n    Tuathan naming conventions date back to the time of the ancient tribe. Most of the names bestowed upon children have their roots in the land from which Tuatha set sail. Popular male names include Bran, Cadeyrn, Dylan, Eogan, Gawain, Iago, Lugh, Maedoc, Merrion, Morcant, Padraig, Roderick, Taliesin, Trystan, Urien, and Wynn. Females are often called Alis, Anwen, Blaithin, Cara, Ceridwen, Elain, Fflur, Glynis, Gwendolyn, Gwyneth, Keelie, Kendal, Megann, Morrigan, Rowena, or Sioned.\n\n{b}Tuathan Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain either Continue the Story or Shapechanger Physique.\nContinue the Story\nYou gain a +1 bonus to death saving throws. In addition, whenever you make an Endurance check, you can roll twice and use either result.\n\nShapechanger&#146;s Physique\nWhenever you make an Athletics check, you can roll twice and use either result.\n\n{b}Tuathan Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain either Heightened Senses or The Tables Are Turned.\nHeightened Senses\nWhen you use your second wind, enemies gain no benefit from any cover or concealment against you until the end of your next turn.\n\nThe Tables Are Turned\nWhen you use your second wind, you gain combat advantage against any enemy flanking you, and being flanked does not cause you to grant combat advantage. This benefit lasts until the end of your next turn.\n\n\n\n    Tuathan Level 10 Feature (10th level): You gain either Flying Animal Shape or Heroic Recovery.\nFlying Animal Shape\nIf you have the tuathan animal shape power, you can use it to assume the form of a Tiny fey or natural beast that can fly (such as a bird or butterfly). In this form, you have a fly speed of 6.\n\nHeroic Recovery\nWhen you make a death saving throw, if the result is 20 or higher (after applying any modifiers), you can immediately end any effect you are subjected to.

  <thing id="thUnsAgnt" name="Unseelie Agent" description="{i}&quot;Go now&#151;and do not let those fool eladrin know it is I whom you truly serve.&quot;{/i}\nThe Feywild is a place of magic and enchantment, but within its shadows lurk creatures of mischief, malice, and malevolence that are the source of horrific campfire tales told about the plane. At best, these dark fey, or Unseelie, are indifferent about the harm they cause with their actions. At worst, they are creatures that carry the taint of shadow magic and seek to snuff out the light of the world.\n    Despite their reputation, these fey attract outsiders seeking their favor&#151;some people just cannot resist the lure of dark magic. The Unseelie are well versed in the shadowy arts and, like many other fey creatures, love the power of bargains. They haggle and barter for what they have to offer, sometimes taking more than the seeker wants to pay in exchange.\n    You are one such seeker. You came to an Unseelie fey creature in search of knowledge, favors, a weapon, a charm, or something else. The asking price was too high, so you pledged yourself into your patron&#146;s service instead. As is the case with many fey pledges, the duration of your service seems open to interpretation. In the meantime, you act as an agent of your patron well beyond the borders of its dominion.\n    The tasks that your Unseelie master asks you to perform do not seem suspicious, and they follow no pattern that you have been able to discern. In fact, most of what you are called to do seems trivial&#151;delivering messages, transporting money or goods, and reporting back on individuals that you observe. Your patron has yet to ask you to do something truly odious, although you realize that such a request might be made one day.\n    In exchange for your service, your Unseelie patron bestows gifts upon you. At the outset of your bargain, your patron gave you a shadow-wrought weapon, a magic item that cements the bond between you. In addition, your master occasionally teaches you small magic tricks or gives you insight into the workings of higher fey powers, expanding your knowledge and expertise. You worry, however, that every gift you receive leaves you further indebted to the Unseelie fey creature, and you fear that it might be difficult, perhaps impossible, to free yourself from its grasp.\n\n{b}Unseelie Agent Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the create shadow-wrought weapon power. When you select the Unseelie agent theme, choose a melee weapon or a ranged weapon with which you have proficiency. The weapon created by this power is the same kind of weapon.\n{b}Unseelie Agent Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You can speak, read, and write the secret language of the Unseelie fey. This language can be used to communicate securely with others of your ilk.\n{b}Unseelie Agent Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} When you make an Intimidate check, you can roll twice and use either result. When you do so, you physically change for a moment, revealing to the person you are attempting to intimidate that you have a supernatural connection to a dark power." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thUthBrb" name="Uthgardt Barbarian" description="{i}What you think of as civilized, I know to be weak. The world is a savage place. It takes savagery to master it.{/i}\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Human\n\nYou are an Uthgardt barbarian&#151;a member of one of the savage human tribes that took Uthgar&#146;s name and worshiped him after he fell defending his people from the Pale Giants in ancient days. The deity Tempus took Uthgar into his service then, and now Uthgar fights beside the Lord of Battle in the realms beyond the mortal world. You are part of the Thunderbeast tribe, and even as you pay homage to Uthgar and the spirits of your ancestors, you keep the sacred secret of those great reptilian creatures where they hide in the shadowed heart of the High Forest.\n    Recently, your tribe left its High Forest home to travel far west to Neverwinter Wood. As is tradition for all Uthgardt, autumn is the time of Runemeet&#151;a holy period when each tribe travels to its ancestor mound to worship the ancient spirits. Your tribe&#146;s mound is Morgur&#146;s Mound, considered to be the holiest site of your people. There, Uthgar shed his blood in battle against Gurt, Lord of the Pale Giants, and broke the back of Gurt&#146;s armies to save the North from domination. Within that same mound are buried the remains of Uthgar&#146;s mortal brother, the hero Morgur.\n    At Runemeet, youths in an Uthgardt tribe who want to become fully recognized members must engage in a ritual hunt of sworn enemies of their tribe&#151;wolves, in the case of the Thunderbeast barbarians. This was to be your hunt year, and you looked forward to the ceremonies and celebrations at the most holy of the ancestor mounds with great anticipation. However, the ceremony was not to be.\n    Your tribe found Morgur&#146;s Mound desecrated. The skeleton of the thunderbeast that had rested atop it for untold generations had been stolen, and the mound broken open like a gutted animal. The holy bones of Uthgar&#146;s brother and the treasures they had been buried with were taken as well.\n    The immensity of the tragedy and the affront to your tribe&#151;indeed, to all Uthgardt&#151;drove your people mad for a time. Once rage cooled to grief, your chieftain Grandthur announced that the tribe would return to the High Forest. Whoever had defiled your ancestor mound had covered their tracks well, and it would take time to discover the culprits. To spend this time so close to the open wound in their hearts would weaken your people, for without an ancestor mound, they could not perform the traditions that would keep them strong.\n    Grandthur declared that the tribe would travel to Flint Rock, the ancestor mound of the Elk Tribe, to join their fellow Uthgardt there. Then the chieftain turned to you.\n    Although you were not yet ceremonially recognized, you had proven yourself an able hunter and a combatant who could rival the veterans of the tribe in skill and tenacity. To replace the ritual hunt that you had been meant to undertake, Grandthur gave you the task of discovering the defilers. It would be your duty to await the return of the Gray Wolf tribe&#151;the Uthgardt who traditionally roam near Neverwinter Wood but who were currently away to the north at their own ancestor mound, Raven Rock. You will ask them what they know of the ruin brought upon your people and request their help in restoring Morgur&#146;s Mound to its sacred purpose. Grandthur also made it clear that if you discover the Gray Wolves had some hand in the desecration, the quarry of your special ritual hunt will be a wolf of a different kind.\n\n{b}Uthgardt Barbarian Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the thunder stomp power.\n{b}Uthgardt Barbarian Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +4 bonus to Perception checks made to find tracks, and a +4 bonus to Insight checks made against beasts and other Uthgardt.\n{b}Uthgardt Barbarian Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +3 power bonus to Intimidate checks" compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thViglnt" name="Vigilante" description="In even the noblest kingdoms, justice can fall by the wayside, and in corrupt or evil ones, villains can often escape fair judgment. Most people stand by and let this pass, but some have a passion for justice that won&#146;t submit to impotent laws. These few take personal charge of seeking out evil and punishing it as they see fit. These people are vigilantes.\n    Vigilantes operate outside the law and therefore must be careful about how they enforce their justice.\nMany hide their true identities behind simple black masks or more elaborate disguises. They must work at night, out of sight of the city watch and their criminal enemies. They are often forced to travel in unorthodox ways, sprinting over city rooftops or skulking through dark alleys and sewers.\n    A vigilante&#146;s impact goes beyond his or her direct work. Vigilantes know that fear of their vengeance can deter would-be evildoers. So, they use dramatic and flamboyant fighting styles to draw their enemies&#146; attention. Further, they often leave a distinctive token with those they bring to justice, ranging from the symbolic, such as a dead rose, to the gruesome, such as carving their symbol into an enemy&#146;s flesh.\n    The common folk develop strong opinions about vigilantes, sometimes labeling them heroes while fearing them as dangerous criminals at other times. It is up to each vigilante to establish a legacy that is most true to his or her brand of justice.\n    {b}Vigilante Level 5 Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a +5 power bonus to Intimidate checks against those who recognize you as a vigilante.\n    {b}Vigilante Starting Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain the mark of the vigilante power.\n    {b}Vigilante Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +1 power bonus to your Will defense." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thWtrshpr" name="Watershaper" description="{i}&quot;I am the still pool and the tempestuous sea.&quot;{/i}\nThe versatility of elemental water manifests in the talents of the watershapers. These elemental devotees can wield water as a weapon, sending waves crashing into their enemies. With experience, a watershaper can discover water&#146;s subtler aspects. Such a master can use water to touch other minds, ease suffering, and alter one&#146;s appearance to stave off age or conceal one&#146;s physical connection to the Elemental Chaos.\n    Of all the expressions of elemental power in the world, the art of watershaping was not an accidental discovery. Most who know of it see it as a blessing from the kindly primordial Ben-hadar to ease the suffering created by the Dawn War. Some skeptics suggest that the &#147;gift&#148; was nothing more than a way to help the primordials maintain a foothold in the natural world. Regardless of the motive behind its existence, watershaping has helped mortals travel around the world by enabling them to brave the ocean&#146;s surface and explore its depths. All waterfaring people count themselves lucky if they have a watershaper in their midst.\n    Watershapers operate as advisors, envoys, and arbitrators in the communities they live in or near. They keep the peace, urging calm in their fellows. As reasonable and diplomatic as watershapers can be, they have a stormy side.

  <thing id="thWrBear" name="Werebear" description="{i}&quot;I do not consider my nature to be a curse. It is a duty. I safeguard the wilds from those who would despoil them.&quot;{/i}\nThe wilderness holds dangers aplenty for the unwary and unprepared. Savage humanoids gather in fell places to launch raids against caravans and homestead alike. Twisted monsters lurk in the shadows and deep caves. Old ruins harbor the spirits of old kings and warriors turned to evil. As dangerous as these realms can be, certain folk take it upon themselves to protect the world and innocents from these threats. From the fearless ranger who prowls the old paths to the druid who secures founts of primal magic from exploitation and ruin, such guardians fight on the front lines against the spreading darkness. Yet they do not fight alone. The legendary werebears emerge from their isolation to fight at their sides and uphold the ancient charge placed upon them by nature&#146;s divine protector.\n    Werebears stand apart from most skinchangers. They lack the evil natures that compel their cousins to commit violence against mankind. Rather than grapple with the bloodlust and savagery so pervasive among the werebeasts, they retain their morality, in part from Melora&#146;s favor and also from the great task they accept as theirs. As Sehanine&#146;s curse spread through the werebeast clans, Melora reached out from her heavenly realm and sheltered the bear clan. They had ever been among her most devout servants and took no part in the misguided effort to steal the moon from the sky. In exchange, she commanded them and all their descendants to protect the world against their fellows&#146; wickedness, to secure the wilderness against the despoiler and destroyer, and, above all, to keep alive the old ways of the world&#146;s magic.\n    Although many werebears descend from the bear clan, others come by their lycanthropic natures in different ways. Rangers, wardens, and others might receive the gift of lycanthropy after performing a great service for the druids or for a nature spirit. Melora sometimes rewards favored priests with the ability to transform into bears after a demonstration of uncommon devotion.\n    Regardless of the transformation&#146;s cause, werebears do not remain in civilized areas. They live alone in unspoiled forests and mountains. They construct crude shelters or settle in caves. And the lands and all the creatures living there for miles around fall under their protection. Werebears tend their lands and watch over their charges to ensure the natural processes are left undisturbed. Should anything or anyone threaten the lands they guard, the werebears respond with deadly force and lead the people and the beasts to destroy their intruder, fighting until no threat remains.\n    Even though many werebears remain in their chosen lands, some do not settle in one place for long. They come to see the entire world as their responsibility. These werebears are the ones most likely to become adventurers, and they crusade against evil in all its forms. They take up with like-minded adventurers, preferring the company of individuals also connected to the spirit world.\n\n{b}Werebear Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against disease.\n    You have the shapechanger subtype. As such, you are subject to effects that affect shapechangers. In addition, any enemy has combat advantage against you when attacking you with a silvered weapon or implement.\n    In addition, you gain the bear shape power.\n{b}Werebear Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} When interacting with bears or similar creatures, you gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks.\n    Additionally, while bear shape is active, you gain a +1 power bonus to AC and Fortitude.\n{b}Werebear Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} When you use the bear shape power, you can assume the form of a humanoid-bear hybrid, instead of a bear. While in hybrid form, your equipment does not become part of your new form, and you are not forced to drop any items you are holding. You are also not limited to using implement and weapon attack powers that have the beast form keyword." compset="Theme">

  <thing id="thWrRat" name="Wererat" description="{i}&quot;People scorn rats, yet are they not among the world&#146;s best survivors?&quot;{/i}\nThey carry plague. They live in squalor and filth. They eat whatever they can, fouling foodstuffs and other supplies with their leavings. And they breed at an alarming rate. For these reasons, most folk consider rats vermin and it&#146;s no surprise that rat catchers patrol almost every city, venturing into the sewers and exploring the docks with dog and club to control the rat population. Whispers circulate among those who do this thankless job about the big rats that can break a ratter&#146;s neck with a single bite. And then some tell stories that no one dares believe: tales of rats who walk upright as humans.\n    Wererats find no more welcome among other skinchangers than they do in civilization. Deemed the lowest form of werebeast, they have few opportunities to interact with other clans. Instead, they keep to their own kind and live with the rats whose warrens they share. More than any other lycanthrope, wererats live among human populations, hiding in plain sight and learning the secret ways in and out of the city to move about unseen when hunting. They claim the sewers, the abandoned buildings, and the slums, where witnesses are rare and reports about their activities go unheard. They are scavengers, picking through civilization&#146;s leavings and spreading their disease wherever they can.\n    Despite the hostility toward wererats coming from all fronts, they not only survive, but also thrive. Wererats might be hated, yet they exist in the largest numbers. They might be rejected, yet they operate in extensive communities so that they do not need assistance or aid from other werebeasts. And although they might lack the ferocity or durability enjoyed by rivals, their swarms can overwhelm even the toughest werewolf.\n    Since wererats live among humans, they have the best opportunities to pursue adventuring classes. Rarely, a wererat might change his or her views regarding humans and make efforts at restitution for past crimes, if not directly to improve the community, then indirectly to fight for other communities. A few wererats owe their natures to a chance encounter with another wererat or plague-bearing dire rat. Once the disease runs its course, the individual is uprooted and searching for a new future as a shapechanger.\n\n{b}Wererat Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Stealth checks.\nYou have the shapechanger subtype.

Run as fast as you can, but I&#146;ll warn you that even that might not be enough.&quot;{/i}\nWhen people think of lycanthropy, they think of werewolves. No other lycanthrope evokes the same fear, even if other lycanthropes might be stronger and more dangerous. Life on the frontiers puts settlers in contact with wolves and, having watched livestock vanish and having fended off attacks against ravenous wolves, the fears seem justified, even though most wolves avoid mankind when they can.\n    Although ordinary wolves are content to go their own way, ranging across the countryside in packs, werewolves hunt humans. They and the wolves they enslave are aggressive, vicious, and unrelenting in their attacks. Werewolf packs are dangerous, since they can scout out the landscape by day in human form and launch attacks by night. They might be fearless in battle, but they avoid the cities where they face discovery and death. Instead, they keep to the wilderness, where their attacks might go unnoticed and where retribution comes slowly&#151;if at all.\n    As with all lycanthropes, being a werewolf is no guarantee of evil. The hunger remains, but a strong will can control it. It is always a struggle, though. A werewolf must always fight to keep the beast in check, and sometimes even the best efforts are not enough. Werewolves seeking redemption for or escape from their natures favor the adventurer&#146;s life since it carries them away from innocents and lets them vent their fury on more deserving foes.\n    Nearly all werewolves inherited their natures from their parents, passing on what many would consider to be a curse. Such werewolves are human or have human blood, such as half-elves or half-orcs. Just about any other natural or fey race could become a werewolf by succumbing to moon frenzy or fall prey to a curse due to their bloodlust.\n\n{b}Werewolf Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Intimidate checks.\n    You have the shapechanger subtype.

All things feed the insatiable hunger of the Spider Queen, but she best rewards those servants who deliver the tastiest sweetmeats of misery and darkness. Such worshipers eschew the decadence of drow society in favor of the simpler, harsher ways of the spider. They retreat to the halls of Arach-Tinilith, swearing themselves entirely to Lolth in a dark sisterhood.\n    From the time you were born, the Spider Queen held you in special favor, granting you great facility with divine magic. Perhaps she foresaw in you remarkable strength, wickedness, or cunning. Whatever the reason, Lolth marked your birth by sending a demonic spider to your side, and it has been your constant companion ever since. You share a natural hunger to feast upon those weaker than yourselves.\n    As a girl, you found refuge within Arach-Tinilith, away from the petty scheming and political ambitions of your sisters. In its comforting embrace, you devoted all your time to serving the Spider Queen in the best way you knew. After many decades of study, you have come to understand the depths of Lolth&#146;s chaotic hedonism in a way few others can, and you are confident in your superiority.\n    Now that you clearly see the underpinnings of drow society, you know that Menzoberranzan stands upon a fragile precipice. You endeavor to serve&#151;and feed&#151;the Spider Queen, but you must maintain the balance of treachery lest the city fall, to the detriment of the goddess and her worshipers.

The presence of the Wild Hunt is felt most strongly in the Feywild, but it sometimes appears in the natural world. No qualification or ritual is necessary to join the Wild Hunt. A rider might be a member of a hunting tribe in either the Feywild or the natural world, a normal person swept up in the glory of the hunt, or someone who made a deal with an impetuous fey lord. When the Wild Hunt appears, each of its riders suddenly vanishes from the world and becomes a member of the horde wherever it might be. The rider reappears at his or her former location days or weeks later with little memory of what happened&#151;just flashes of rage and hunger, embodying the thrill of the hunt. No one on the hunt ever remembers what was being hunted or why.\n    Firbolgs, giant-sized hunters from the Feywild, make up much of the rank and file of the hunt. When the firbolgs accept a Wild Hunt rider into their numbers, that individual also becomes an honorary member of the tribe. This is not a choice the firbolgs make; they simply sense that the rider belongs.

  <thing id="thWizzApp" name="Wizard&apos;s Apprentice" description="Apprentices exist in any trade, of course, but none are more famous&#151;or infamous&#151;than wizards&#146; apprentices. Stories tell of foolish apprentices stealing peeks at books that should not be opened, fumbling love charms, or botching transmutations by treating dangerous magic as a clever toy. Other tales recall clever apprentices who come up with just the right spell to save a village while their masters are away, or boldly putting their lessons to good use as they set out in search of adventure. Whether they turn out to be rash or resourceful, wizards&#146; apprentices begin their careers with a priceless advantage: the personal instruction and tutelage of an experienced master.\n    In exchange for the privilege of learning magic, wizards&#146; apprentices normally spend years engaged in whatever drudgery and chores their masters deem fitting. A typical human wizard&#146;s apprentice begins his or her studies around the age of eleven or twelve and remains in the master&#146;s household for five or six years. Experienced spellcasters can take on apprentices for a variety of reasons: to share their appreciation of the art, to repay the work of their own masters by instructing a worthy student, or to tutor a young noble. Surprisingly, many of the most reclusive or suspicious&#151;even evil&#151;spellcasters take on apprentices; some regard it as their duty to pass along their learning, some hope to shape talented young mages into future allies (or minions), and others desire an audience to witness the brilliance of their schemes. Evil masters are often callous or exacting, but only the stupidest are actively sadistic toward their apprentices; after all, it&#146;s not wise to share secrets of power with someone you&#146;ve caused to hate you.\n    Adventuring wizards&#146; apprentices are usually young adults whose training is more or less complete. They no longer live in their masters&#146; households, and they aren&#146;t obligated to wash floors or scrub pots between lessons. Assuming such an individual parted from his or her master on good terms, the apprentice has at least one knowledgeable patron willing to offer advice and assistance in important matters. Many wizards&#146; apprentices retain their loyalty to their masters throughout their lifetimes, even if they surpass their masters&#146; achievements. Apprentices who were taught by particularly powerful or famous masters can serve as agents and allies of those mentors, and they see themselves as the appointed guardians of a long and honored tradition. Just as noble families have ancestral lines going back centuries, many famous spellcasters likewise come from lines of apprentice&#150;master relationships tracing back to famous wizards or sorcerers of old.\n\n{b}Wizard&apos;s Apprentice Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the color orb power.\n{b}Wizard&apos;s Apprentice Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain one level 6 or lower common magic implement, armor, or neck slot item of your choice.\n{b}Wizard&apos;s Apprentice Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +3 power bonus to Arcana checks, and you learn one new language (other than Supernal)." compset="Theme" uniqueness="unique">

Occasionally, someone adds salt.&quot;{/i}\n\nPatterns. Rules. Order. These are tools of the dim and the ignorant use to attempt to codify the multiverse and understand it. Instead, Xaositects (also known as the Chaosmen) believe that the answer is staring everyone in the face: There are no rules, and there is no deeper meaning to existence. Attempting to impose any kind of structure is antithetical to what it all means, and trying to stem the tide of change and disorder puts you farther away from understanding it all and finding your place in the chaotic sea of reality.\n    If this view is true, does that mean that all reality is meaningless, and everyone should sink into despair? Yes and no. (Or no and yes.) Other factions might wallow in doom and gloom over this perceived futility, but the Xaositects&#146; understanding goes deeper than that. Down into despair is certainly one direction, but a body who embraces chaos is equally likely to float up into happiness, or sideways into the street. Reality is meaningless, but a lack of meaning isn&#146;t a bad thing in and of itself. Abandoning a search for meaning is the surest way to find it. The more your life reflects chaos, the more your life is like the multiverse, and both are sources of endless surprise.\n\n{b}Xaositect Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the Babble power.\n\n{b}Xaositect Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to Arcana checks and Bluff checks.\n\n{b}Xaositect Level 10 Feature (10th level):{/b} You gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks.

  <thing id="thYakuza" name="Yakuza" description="Outcasts, renegades, folk heroes, and criminals&#151;the yakuza are many things to different people, but without exception they are the rejects of a society that values conformity. There is a saying in Kozakura: &#147;The nail that sticks up must be hammered down.&#148; The yakuza proudly view themselves as these nails, but refuse to be treated as such.\n    Although the true nature of the yakuza is hard to identify, most will agree that collectively they are scoundrels who live by their own rules and code of honor. Banding together in clannish groups, yakuza gain security and power by exploiting society through robbery or extortion. Most are viewed as criminals, but not necessarily with distaste; the unusual behavior of the yakuza makes them both loved and despised in the cities in which they operate.\n    Yakuza often work as street peddlers, smugglers, thugs, gamblers, or racketeers. They associate with each other through bonds of loyalty to their clan, which might include hundreds of members. Yakuza clans are highly organized using a hierarchical structure with the boss taking on the role of father and his subordinates the obedient children. Loyalty and honor are paramount to yakuza, though they eschew the ethics of bushido in favor of more pragmatic concerns.\n    In the view of most merchants and the officials of cities, yakuza are law-breaking thugs and criminals. The yakuza cultivate their image as iconoclasts, and purposefully commit robberies and vandalism to ruffle the feathers of authority. A yakuza clan often becomes the recognized face of crime within a city, wallowing in a self-made underworld; however, yakuza also realize that their livelihood depends on existing in the shadows of civilization, and they are not unnecessarily destructive of people or property in their criminal enterprises.\n    Some yakuza go so far as to actively attend to the needs of their communities, using resources to help those that the ruling classes have ignored. Many peasants view the yakuza as heroes standing up for the underdog against a society that treads on them. A yakuza clan might defend peasants from bandits or the brutality of an arrogant samurai. Some clans donate wealth to improving the infrastructure of their city. Yakuza have even acted as spies or assassins during times of war to protect their cities from the ravages of loot-hungry attackers. In some cases, these actions are viewed with a standoffish respect by authorities, who allow the yakuza to operate with impunity as long as their criminal activities don&#146;t get out of hand.\n\n{b}Yakuza Starting Feature (1st level):{/b} You gain the ruthless demonstration power.\n{b}Yakuza Level 5 Feature (5th level):{/b} When you hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you, your opportunity attacks gain a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against that enemy until the start of your next turn.
