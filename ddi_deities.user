Many deities were less than pleased with Aurom&apos;s claim on so many subjects. Aurom was slain by Nerull, a powerful mortal necromancer seeking divinity. Nerull took only the portfolio of death from the dead deity and left Aurom&apos;s other portfolios to be divided among the other deities, thus securing a place among them.{br}Aurom&apos;s existence was long hidden, since Nerull erased any knowledge of his predecessor that he could track down. Those who taught that Nerull had not always been the only god of the dead met horrible fates. The truth finally came to light when the Raven Queen slew Nerull and saw a benefit in weakening that god&apos;s original hold by revealing the truth of his origins.{br}Little is known of Aurom despite the Raven Queen&apos;s revelations, and few people agree on what he or she was really like. Various sects have sprung up, each with radically different ideas. Most sects survived for only a short while. The only sect to have persisted for more than a few decades now is the Enclave of Dust. Most members are dry and bookish, dispassionate folk who see death as a necessity. They renounce the importance of the soul. Their particularly morose outlook means their cult has been small over the years, but also has kept them from becoming important enough to be a target for elimination.{br}The Enclave of Dust today speculates that Aurom taught the following:{br}* Everything is part of the cycle. We are born. We live. We die. Respect life, and know death to be a part of it.{br}* We are created from the elements and return to the chaos when it ends. The primordials are our enemies. They seek to undo the cycle, refusing to be part of it.{br}* Undeath is a punishment and trial.

He had no enemies among the other deities, who recognized him as a force whose power protected them.{br}In the last years of the Dawn War, Io&apos;s violent death caused a rift between the planes. Haramathur realized the only way to prevent the primordials from using the rift to invade the Astral Sea was to close off the way with his own essence. He sacrificed himself by turning himself and everything around him to stone to seal the rift. Few individuals know Haramathur&apos;s role in these events. The deities try to limit any knowledge of what happened because they fear that someone might seek to restore Haramathur to his original form, and hence restart the war.{br}Haramathur&apos;s body exists in two different locations, with one in the Astral Plane and one in the Elemental Chaos. In the Astral Plane, his essence is interwoven with the realm now known as Erishani (described in The Plane Above). Here, Haramathur&apos;s remaining power holds in stasis an ancient primordial. Few are aware of his influence there, and other deities leave this realm alone. Only a few key people in the settlement of Rhym Katal know the truth.{br}In the Elemental Chaos, Haramathur&apos;s stone body drifts in a calm area that exists in a twenty-mile wide maelstrom of rock, ash, and molten lava. The area is called Mael Arn&apos;dreygh, or the Sealed Way. The stony form holds only one settlement: a fortresslike githzerai monastery hewn from the rock. The githzerai monks, who call themselves the Disciples of Stone, are rumored to communicate with stone, and they are led by Asaerte Nedanar, a powerful psion. Asaerte knows the full history of Haramathur and Mael Arn&apos;dreygh, but he has not yet passed this knowledge along to a successor or allowed anyone into the monastery&apos;s inner sanctum. The monastery is also the only place that possesses written records of the event, which are chiseled in the stone walls of the inner sanctum.{br}Some say that those who become lost in the maelstrom around Mael Arn&apos;dreygh might end up in the bogs of Erishani, and vice versa. So far, none who have disappeared in the maelstrom have ever returned alive.{br}When still alive, Haramathur taught the following:{br}* Protect those for whom you care, as well as those who cannot protect themselves.{br}* Patience is a virtue. Wait for your enemies to move. Stay ever vigilant.{br}* Do not fear the darkness. Train yourself to be aware of your enemies with all your senses.{br}* The earth is your friend.

The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.{br}{br}As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:{br}-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual.

She was originally an assassin for her father, supporting his schemes by murdering his opponents. When she failed to assassinate a high priest of Pelor, she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin&apos;s holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn.{br}Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest&apos;s quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil.{br}Nusemnee was later killed by a poison that could kill anything - even a deity - that was distilled from Zehir&apos;s blood. Her body, a scaly withered husk, drifts in one of the darkest portions of the Astral Sea, where it is sought out by redemption seekers. Some say that Nusemnee&apos;s blood still holds a poison strong enough to kill even Zehir. Vicious devils and a force of yuan-ti abominations guard the body in Zehir&apos;s name. So far, nobody has drawn a single drop of blood from her dehydrated corpse.{br}Since Nusemnee died relatively recently, a number of cults and priests still exist today. Their numbers dwindle as people turn their worship to other deities. Temples to Nusemnee exist in twilight places, city slums, and the upper Underdark, where those most in need of redemption can be found.{br}When still alive, Nusemnee taught the following:{br}* It is never too late to seek redemption.{br}* True heroism does not come from good deeds. It comes from doing good when it matters.{br}* Nobody is perfect. Those who seek to be perfect will fail.

Although a single individual from the intelligent races offered more power than a lonely insect, Sagawehn&apos;s flock came in much larger numbers.{br}Sagawehn was a passionless deity who valued the community - the hive - above all else. She sought to crush individuality, perceiving it as a danger to the whole. She aimed to expand always; those she met either joined the hive or were crushed by it. Understandably, she was never popular among humankind, though some thri-kreen tribes paid her homage.{br}Sagawehn originally resided in Arvandor, but her expansionism soon came into conflict with other beings on that plane, especially the fey that worshiped Corellon. Faced with either assimilation or war, the fey, backed with powerful divine magic, attempted to stop Sagawehn and drive her back.{br}After a long war, several powerful eladrin heroes sought out Sagawehn to either stop the invasion or slay her. She appeared as a mass of beetles, spiders, and other vermin. In an epic battle Sagawehn was slain - but not before many eladrin fell, among them the priestess whose last magic spell took Sagawehn&apos;s life.{br}No astral corpse remains of Sagawehn. Some say she is not truly dead, but that her legacy continues on in the lamia that spawned from the high priestess who fell to the vermin that devoured her.{br}The priests in Sagawehn&apos;s cults are called hive masters.

  <thing id="dtyUthgar" name="Uthgar" description="Father of the Uthgardt barbarians of the Savage Frontier, Uthgar is a proud, fierce, and independent warrior. According to some legends he is the son of Beorunna (a Netherese warrior hero whose followers became the barbarian tribes of the North), while others claim he is the divine offspring of mighty Tempus. The Battle Father has few friends and has remained relatively uninvolved in divine politics. Although he is a tireless and methodical tactician, his battle strategies are not terribly inspired. He is driven to win in the long run, however, especially if the Uthgardt barbarians are threatened." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">
