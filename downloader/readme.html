<p class="body">This program is included with the Hero Lab 4e data files to help you download game data from the D&D insider website. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the game system directory - probably something like <font class="strong">c:\HeroLab\data\4e\</font> - and launch the ddidownloader.exe program. The following screen should appear:

<p class="body"><img src="downloader.png"/>

<p class="body">Pressing 1-5 selects one of the following options:

<ol class="default">

<li><font class="strong">Download data (no D&D insider account)</font><br>
This option downloads all publically accessible data from D&D insider. Once completed, you can press any key to exit.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: Since not all data is publically available from D&D insider, only partial information will be available for the game system.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: This download may take up to 10-20 minutes to complete.</li>

<li><font class="strong">Download data (with D&D insider account)</font><br>
This option asks for your D&D insider username and password, then downloads all accessible data from D&D insider. Once completed, you can press any key to exit.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: Although we ask for your username and password, we don't store it or send it anywhere other than to the D&D insider login page.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: This download may take up to 20-60 minutes to complete.</li>

<li><font class="strong">Convert existing data</font><br>
This option can be used if you have previously downloaded data from D&D insider, and wish to recreate the Hero Lab files from the raw data. You should use this if you modify the downloaded files (the files with names beginning ddi_) and wish to restore them to their original state.</li>

<li><font class="strong">Delete existing data</font><br>
This option deletes the Hero Lab files generated from D&D insider (all files with names beginning ddi_).</li>

<li><font class="strong">Exit</font><br>
This option exits the program without taking any actions.</li>

</ol>

<p class="body">Once data has been downloaded, the downloader generates multiple files in its directory (named ddi_*) that contain the data retrieved from D&D insider. After the download has finished, relaunch Hero Lab or reload the game system to gain access to the new data.

<p class="body">The downloader is open source; you can find the source code at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ddidownloader/">http://code.google.com/p/ddidownloader/</a>.
