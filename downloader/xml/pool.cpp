    This file includes:

    Implementation of a class for managing a storage pool. The pool can be
    allocated from in pieces, growing as needed. When the pool is no longer
    needed, all resources are disposed of at once. The advantage of a pool is
    that it is ideal for handling high-performance allocations of small chunks
    (such as small strings) without all of the overhead of the memory manager.
    No individual allocations can be freed, so it's great when reading in a
    file or synthesizing data for subsequent output - process the entire block
    of data, then discard it all in one shot.

    Note! All storage herein is consequentive, without any sentinels or overrun
            checking. Memory allocated from a pool must be handled with care,
            else the entire pool can be corrupted quite readily.
