  <thing id="rtAberrTot" name="Aberrant Totemic Link" description="When you master this ritual, you choose a single type of aberrant creature, such as chaos beast or mind flayer. This choice remains fixed throughout your adventuring career. If you are able to create ritual scrolls, any scrolls you create also reflect this choice. This ritual can only be mastered once.{br}For the ritual&apos;s duration, you are able to determine the presence or absence of creatures of the chosen type within 10 miles, but with no specific direction or distance information. If there are any within range, you can connect to the mind of a random creature of that type and try to gain information from it. The strain of making this connection (and of concealing it from the aberrant creature) causes you to lose one healing surge.{br}Your Dungeoneering check result determines how many questions you can try to find the answers to. Once you have asked all the questions allowed by the ritual, the ritual ends.{br}Your questions can be as specific or as general as you wish, but the answers you receive back are cryptic and rarely longer than a phrase, a short sentence, or a single image. In particular, aberrant creatures often have different conceptions of time, so questions regarding future events or plans are more likely to result in answers that are incomprehensible. The answers are also limited to what the individual creature knows, and its information could be incorrect if it has been misled by others.{br}{br}Dungeoneering Check Result - Number of Questions{br}9 or lower - One{br}10-19 - Two{br}20-29 - Three{br}30-39 - Four{br}40 or higher - Five{br}{br}If a particular creature does not know the information you seek, you can try to find another individual who does know it. If there is another such creature, you lose an additional healing surge, and you may re-ask any questions you wish answers for.{br}Members of the Morphic Web can master and perform this ritual even if they cannot normally master rituals. They also do not lose a healing surge when making the first connection to an aberrant creature." compset="Ritual">

Unless it is prevented from doing so, the creature can leave at any time. Finally, you must be able to communicate with the creature, or the ritual automatically fails.{br}{br}To determine the extent of your authority over the subject, you engage in a special skill challenge during the time it takes to perform the ritual. The DCs for the checks in this challenge are equal to the subject&apos;s level + 10. Religion is the primary skill; each time you or an ally succeeds on a Religion check in the challenge, you or an ally can use Diplomacy, History, Arcana, or Intimidate for one subsequent check. Once you have amassed 3 failures or achieved 10 successes, the skill challenge ends. Consult the following table and apply the effect associated with the number of successes you achieved.{br}{br}Number of Successes - Effect{br}0 or 1 - The creature has authority over you and can issue one command that you must obey, a task that requires up to a day of effort.{br}2 or 3 - You have immediate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform one task that takes no more than 5 minutes.{br}4 or 5 - You have moderate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a day of effort.{br}6 or 7 - You have significant authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a week of effort.{br}8 or 9 - You have great authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a month of effort. {br}10 - You have ultimate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a year and a day of effort.{br}{br}When the specified task is completed, the ritual is discharged, and the creature (or you) is released from service. You can request any kind of service that does not compel the subject to obey multiple commands, force the subject to engage in combat, or ensure the subject&apos;s death.

The scarecrow also grants its creator brief visions through its eyes until the scarecrow is destroyed or until its creator dismisses it. This protected area surrounds the scarecrow&apos;s mount and is established as the scarecrow&apos;s &quot;haunting grounds.&quot;{br}Before you cast this ritual, you gather the specific components for the type of scarecrow you wish to create and place them upon a scarecrow mount. This mount can be a high pole or stake, a tree, a fencepost, a wooden frame, or a similar structure from which the scarecrow can survey the area it guards. This mount is the scarecrow&apos;s permanent post. It can leave its mount at will and it can patrol its haunting grounds, but it cannot willingly venture beyond them unless a combat encounter causes it to cross the perimeter (but see below). At the end of such an encounter, the scarecrow returns to its haunting grounds.{br}If the scarecrow&apos;s creator commands it beyond its haunting grounds, moves its mount, or releases it from service, the scarecrow gains its freedom and is no longer bound to its mount or its haunting grounds. It has complete free will and can do as it wishes. Some creators never bind their scarecrows to haunting grounds. Instead, they offer their free-willed creations friendship and the choice to ally with their creators as companion characters. Free-willed scarecrows created by good creatures often choose to serve their creators this way.{br}To complete the Create Scarecrow ritual, make a DC 25 Arcana check.{br}Success: You successfully create the scarecrow of your choice of the ritual caster&apos;s level or lower. Demon  scarecrows can be created with this ritual only after completing a successful performance of the summon demon ritual.{br}Failure: No spirit is compelled to inhabit the effigy. Instead, minor spirit vestiges settle on the materials, allowing you to create 6 scarecrow shamblers to patrol the same haunting grounds.{br}No matter how many creatures assist in the ritual, the creature that makes the Arcana check is considered the scarecrow&apos;s creator.{br}A scarecrow created with this ritual gains the following encounter power.{br}{br}Triggered Actions{br}Master&apos;s Sight * Encounter{br}Trigger: The scarecrow hits an enemy with a melee attack.{br}Effect (Free Action): The scarecrow&apos;s creator can see through the scarecrow&apos;s eyes until the start of the scarecrow&apos;s next turn." compset="Ritual">

A translucent blue hand appears and indicates with a gesture what the most rewarding course of action is.{br}If you describe courses of action that refer to directions or specific objects, then the hand points toward the choice that bears the greatest reward. If you ask the hand, &quot;Should we head down the stairs or through the doors?&quot; then the hand responds by pointing either to the stairs or the doors. If you ask the hand, &quot;Which of these three levers should we pull first?&quot; then the hand responds by pointing to a lever.{br}If you describe only a single course of action, the ritual assumes that inaction is your other option. The hand either beckons you (to indicate that you should proceed) or gestures for you to halt. For example, the question &quot;Should we explore the ruins of Solitronia?&quot; results in the hand either beckoning you or gesturing for you to halt.{br}The hand can&apos;t assess events in the far future; its judgment extends only to likely events in the next hour. If the hand can&apos;t indicate a preference, the ritual has no effect and expends no components.{br}There are two drawbacks to using the ritual to aid your decisions. First, fate values rewards over risk, and this ritual provides guidance accordingly. It points you toward a high risk, high reward option before pointing you toward a low risk, low reward alternative. For example, if one tunnel leads to a dragon and great wealth and the other tunnel leads back to town, then the hand points toward the dragon. However, a high risk, low reward alternative is considered less rewarding than a low risk, low reward option.{br}Second, the hand can choose only the most rewarding course of action relative to the alternatives provided. That doesn&apos;t mean that the indicated choice is necessarily a good idea, only that it&apos;s a better idea than the other options you&apos;ve indicated. In the example above, if all three levers activate traps, then the hand points toward the lever that triggers a trap less lethal than the others." compset="Ritual">

This temporary teleportation circle must exactly match the permanent teleportation circle at your destination. It disappears at the end of the portal&apos;s duration.{br}At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana check.

The creature can even finish the rest of its move. Any number of creatures of any size can use an open portal; the only limitation is the number that can reach the circle before it ends.{br}Anyone standing in the vicinity of either end of the portal can see a haze-infused vision of the teleportation circle at the other end of the connection, as well as the environment 60 feet beyond it. Effectively, everything at the destination within this area of visibility is lightly obscured, and the area beyond is completely fogged out. (Naturally, portals that last longer give you a better opportunity to study the place you&apos;re going to before you step into the circle.) Environmental effects at one end of the connection don&apos;t affect the other end.{br}Most major temples, important wizards&apos; guilds, and large cities have permanent teleportation circles, each of which has a unique set of magic sigils etched or inlaid into the ground. The exact sequence of sigils matters, because you&apos;ve got to match it if you want to open a portal leading there. The sigils aren&apos;t any more complex than remembering a string of letters and numbers. You can use Linked Portal to any permanent teleportation circle whose sequence of sigils you know. When you learn this ritual, your DM will tell you at least two such sequences. In your travels and research, you&apos;ll undoubtedly learn more.{br}This ritual can take you anywhere in the world, but it can&apos;t take you to other planes. Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block a teleportation ritual. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components." compset="Ritual">

You must name a specific demon when you perform this ritual, then make an Arcana or Religion check with a -10 penalty. The check result is the maximum level of the demon whose attention you can attract. If the demon you named in performing the ritual is at this level or lower, a fragment of its will manifests before you. If the demon you named is higher than the maximum level you can summon, it is aware of your summons but can choose to send an underling to answer the call instead.{br}Once a demon has manifested, you can interact with it verbally or by telepathy as if it were present. The manifestation has no physical presence, and it cannot attack or be attacked. Demons possess esoteric knowledge and the ability to empower mortals in numerous ways, but the advice or power of a demon is never given freely. Some demons accept trade of magic items or secrets, while others demand favors or promises for their aid and information. Some demons offer service in exchange for being told what unpleasant ends the boon is to be used for.{br}The ritual facilitates the bargain between you and the summoned demon, imbuing you with a small amount of abyssal power or knowledge. The terms of the bargain are up to you, but the DM determines the scope of power and knowledge that a demon can impart.{br}In addition, convincing a demon to provide what you need typically requires a skill challenge. The details of this challenge are left up to the DM, but can include such elements as bargaining with Diplomacy, threatening with Intimidate, or coercing with knowledge gleaned by Arcana or Religion. Failure ends the ritual and might bring the summoned demon to your location in physical form.{br}Special: If you use a demon&apos;s truename in the ritual in place of its name, you take no penalty to the Arcana or Religion check made for the ritual. In addition, you do not need to undertake a skill challenge to bargain with the summoned demon (at the DM&apos;s discretion).{br}Few demons except demon lords have truenames, and demon lords guard their truenames at any cost. If you summon a demon lord by the use of its truename, the bargain you strike should also involve ensuring that you are not destroyed once the pact is completed.{br}Focus: A circle of summoning runes.
