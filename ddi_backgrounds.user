On the other hand, mastery of your powers might be as natural to you as regulating your breathing, a simple matter of directing your will and energy outward and creating the magical manifestation you desire. In either case, those who study and train for years to master the merest scraps of magical power look upon you with envy or perhaps fear, for power comes readily to your hand, for good or for ill. You feel a kinship and affinity for dragons, and you might dream of one day transforming yourself into that pinnacle of the draconic form - or of subjugating dragons to your will.{br}{br}Most dragon-blooded spellcasters are sorcerers who practice Dragon Magic or bards who extol the Virtue of Valor. Dragon-blooded bards lift up dragons as the exemplars of valor, and many of their spells take on draconic characteristics. For example, your shout of triumph might be a draconic roar that creates a brief image of a dragon around or above you to strike terror in your enemies&apos; hearts, while your song of storms might make you appear as a blue dragon while the effect persists.{br}{i}Associated Skills: {/i}Arcana" compset="Background" uniqueness="unique">

You might have learned them in a monastery (making this a particularly appropriate background element for avengers) or come up with them on your own, perhaps in reaction against more traditional teachings that were instilled in you earlier in life. You might, for example, worship Melora as the great catastrophic dragon of the ocean depths, the third and mightiest spawn of Io. Or you might revere Tiamat as an unaligned deity of fair retribution, twisting the traditional understanding of her thirst for vengeance into a quality that is at least palatable, if not admirable. Perhaps you believe that all the deities are actually dragons ascended to godhood who are simply exemplars who show mortals the path to the same ascension.{br}{br}Since being unconventional defines much of your character, look for other ways you can defy expectations in your character choices. Don&apos;t make choices that prevent you from fulfilling your role, but anything else is fair game. An unexpected multiclass feat (a lawful good paladin with the Pact Initiate feat who dabbles in infernal warlock powers), or atypical weapon and armor choices (an avenger who disdains stealth and wears heavy armor) can go a long way toward making your character seem unorthodox - and interesting.{br}{i}Associated Skills: {/i}Arcana, History" compset="Background" uniqueness="unique">

Do all the gods but Asmodeus favor your fate, or might some have reason to continue dealing with the devils for another thousand years?{br}{br}A protecting or virtuous paladin makes a great choice for this background. Give some thought to the deity your character favors. You might be a generalist who worships the whole pantheon and opposes the god&apos;s enemies, or you might function as the secret weapon of a particular deity with an axe to grind with Asmodeus. If your DM allows, you might even serve an evil deity.

The swordmage has powers such as inferno&apos;s sword and hell&apos;s own blade. The sorcerer and wizard classes have plenty of fiery powers that could have infernal ties. Bard presents relatively few powers that are obviously appropriate, but as with any arcane class, you could link a power to hell by describing it in a thematic way.

On a cold midwinter night you awoke to screams of terror, and you didn&apos;t have to wait long to understand why. Several ghosts of soldiers came through your walls and ordered you to leave. They needn&apos;t have bothered - the sight alone of the terrible apparitions had you scurrying for the exit. Some in your village tried to fight, but to no avail. Their pitchforks and swords passed harmlessly through the spirits, while the ghosts&apos; spectral weapons slashed your friends&apos; bodies. Phantom arrows flickering with pale flames ignited real fires in the buildings. Hot blood steamed on icy ground.{br}You fled with many others, and in the days of travel that followed, more died from starvation,  sickness, exhaustion, and cold. With each new corpse in a grave dug shallow in frost-hardened ground, your desire for vengeance grew. You were lucky; you survived the ordeal. But how can you take revenge on the dead? When you got back to civilization, you resolved to find out.{br}{i}Associated Skills: {/i}Arcana, Nature, Religion" compset="Background" uniqueness="unique">

This idea fit well with the stories you heard as a child about how tieflings would one day resurrect Bael Turath and rule once again.{br}{br}For a while, you thought you might help start that rebirth, but your better judgment saved you from life as an evil despot.

Certain places, far from the frequently traveled corridors, are filled with eddies and swirls of primal power, spawning new life out of the ruins of old. Such places are called the Underwild, and in them fungus forests, sweeps of phosphorescent mold, and slime pools gather primal energy for use by those who have the courage to seize it. Those who discover the Underwild also find abundant food, water, and other resources to help them survive the otherwise desolate Underdark.{br}Originating from the Underdark, you have seen its wonders and its wickedness. Drow is the best racial choice for this homeland, and the dark elves make interesting barbarians and druids.

Giants, the descendants of ancient empires, make their homes across the continent, worshiping strange, arcane powers or violent primal spirits. Relics and ruins of a past demonic age occasionally birth horrors far worse than giants.{br}Yet for all its dangers, Xen&apos;drik attracts the interest of many of Khorvaire&apos;s inhabitants, particularly the dragon marked houses. Many of Eberron&apos;s people - including elves and warforged - can trace their lineage to this forgotten land, and they seek to fill in the gaps of their own history. The riches of the giants&apos; empire wait for explorers, as do the vast fields of dragon shards. The jungle lands are verdant, and if they could be tamed, they would offer grand opportunities for farming and settlement.{br}Only a small number of settlements established by foreigners have survived on Xen&apos;drik. Most are tiny frontier towns, maintained by a rich patron or a dragon marked house. The famous port of Stormreach is the only one of them that has managed to become a full-fledged city.{br}{i}Associated Skills: {/i}Nature" compset="Background" uniqueness="unique">
