The ancient adamantine dragon&apos;s influence didn&apos;t spread into the land of sun and wind, but in the rock, ore, and fungus of the Underdark, his benevolence erected an island of good under the earth. Long ago, the Great Teacher rescued a group of dragonborn that that were beset by denizens of the Underdark, and instead of returning to the surface, these dragonborn devoted themselves to the Adamantine. They became his Adamant Instructors and together they forged a noble nation around the Great Teacher&apos;s hoard in the cavern complex they called Adamanth. The dragonborn prospered under the Teacher&apos;s guidance, and Adamanth became a haven for all that was good and strong. Even some drow and duergar were drawn by the Great Teacher&apos;s benevolence to renounce their darker ways and live in peace under the rule of the Adamant Instructors.{br}{br}Then one day the Great Teacher departed Adamanth to deal with a nasty group of purple dragons that were slaughtering his people on the borders of his influence. He never returned. For decades, the Adamant Instructors have followed the Great Teacher&apos;s instructions, which were carved on a disk of solid adamantine in flowing draconic script by the ancient dragon before he departed. But the Adamant Instructors are hard-pressed to keep hope alive in Adamanth. Purple worms continue to assail them, the drow are assembling an army, and rumors say that mind flayers are stirring in the deep caves to the west.

Honorable and decent people respect the Argentum Alliance, and the unscrupulous and corrupt fear it. All flights of chromatic dragons dread the justice of the Alliance, but the white dragons especially seek the destruction of Hoar Frost Castle. Backed by the power of the ancient silver dragon Sephitherax, the Alliance can help people overthrow evil despots or theocrats. They are the first to respond to volcanic eruptions or floods to maintain order and defend people from those who might prey upon weakness. An Argentum Agent is a savior and a welcome sight to the impoverished.{br}{br}Many a fierce dragonborn, inspired by the tales of the bravery of the Alliance, makes his or her way to the summit of the tallest mountain to Hoar Frost Castle, where each expects to be judged by Sephitherax. In the bailey yard of the castle, with thick ice encrusting the flags and silverwork, each dragonborn kneels before the hundred steps before the citadel.{br}{br}The ancient silver questions each supplicant. When Sephitherax raises his left claw, the candidate is banished from Hoar Frost Castle immediately. When the wise old dragon raises his right claw, the supplicant might one day become an Argentum Agent, but that day is not today. He or she is given a hot meal and sent down the mountain with the expectation that he or she will perform worthy tasks before returning to the Castle one year hence to be judged again. If the candidate is worthy, Sephitherax pronounces him or her an Argentum Agent by raising both claws and embracing the dragonborn. Rarely is a dragonborn raised the first time he or she is presented to Sephitherax; many are judged two or three times before Sephitherax declares the supplicant an Argentum Agent.{br}{br}Brothers train at Hoar Frost Castle, and they learn to harness the frigid winds from Sephitherax. The color of the scales of an Argentum Agent fade over time and are replaced with a metallic gleam. None are sure if this transformation is due to the icy conditions or the proximity and blessing of the Heart of Sephitherax, an amulet artifact bestowed to the ancient silver by Bahamut.{br}{br}ARGENTUM ALLIANCE  PATH FEATURES{b}Argent Action (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to make an attack, you mark each enemy within 5 squares of you until the end of your next turn.{br}{b}Argent Breath (11th level){/b}: Your dragon breath racial power deals cold damage in addition to any damage type it dealt previously.

Tempered by suffering and endless labor, and without access to soldierly methods, these dwarves tailored their ways of fighting to their work tools. They developed martial techniques that allowed them to be flexible in combat. A rebel needs ranged capability to kill in ambushes and slay retreating adversaries. Skill in melee is required to stand up to larger and quicker foes.{br}Revolutionary dwarves took up their hammers and axes. They threw these tools into the faces of their oppressors. Then, hammering and hewing from underfoot, the first avalanche hurlers brought their outsized masters down and escaped to the wilderness. They settled in underground halls they cut for themselves, places too small for their enemies to invade. Dwarves then made war on giants in Moradin&apos;s name. {br}Dwarf clans have maintained the avalanche hurler fighting style across the generations. They preserve their earliest original combat style, but they never held it so sacred that they failed to give it to allies among all sorts of folk. Further, the avalanche hurler might have been originally recorded in dwarven folklore, but other races developed similar military methods independently.{br}As an ever resourceful avalanche hurler, you are effective both in close combat and at range.

Fey  creatures, its children, are bathed in its supernatural flow. Even the simplest among them have powers beyond those of worldly mortals, bestowing simple tasks with an otherworldly enchantment.{br}Eladrin are among the heritors of the Feywild&apos;s nature. As humans and other races tamed portions of the world, so too did the eladrin subdue parts of the Feywild according to their fey temperament. They evolved a complex society, rich in crafts and traditions that also sing in concordance with the Feywild. As followers of mores inspired in elder days by the god Corellon, eladrin treat life and all its aspects as an art. Everything they do, wonderful or wicked, reflects this ideal.{br}Like their counterparts in the world, eladrin have had to fight and die to defend their way of life. Each eladrin learns to wield the longsword, the traditional weapon of the eladrin people. They have martial disciplines that teach an eladrin to channel the innate magic in his or her spirit, as well as that stored within the elements.{br}A blade from the Feywild or crafted by eladrin hands has a special beauty. The metal vibrates with bizarre potential. Some eladrin learn to make steel shaped into such a blade sing its heart&apos;s song.

They come in many different forms from place to place - long files of slave porters, pack trains of heavily laden crodlus and kanks, wagons drawn by snorting inixes, and of course the towering mekillot-drawn argosy wagons that are wooden fortresses on wheels. Regardless of the beasts of burden or the goods carried, caravans are crucial to maintaining Athasian civilization. Not only do they carry valuable goods from one city to the next, they also carry rumors and tales of doings all across the Tyr Region to people thirsty for news of other places, provide travelers with the opportunity to surround themselves with the safety of numbers, and feed scores of desert outposts and settlements with a steady stream of food and supplies.{br}Leading a successful caravan is no mean feat. Disaster in a hundred guises waits in the desert - hungry monsters, savage raiders, ruthless competitors, scourging sandstorms, unreliable wells, mutinous drivers, and the possibility that the goods turn out to be worth less than one paid for them when they reach market. From day to day, a caravan master might have to lead the guards and drivers in battle, search out a new path when a familiar road is buried in the shifting sands, bribe greedy officials, or enforce brutal discipline on a rebellious underling. It takes a rare combination of character judgment, business acumen, and physical courage - attributes you&apos;ve cultivated for years.

In numerous places, the land, sky, and sea roil in a never-ending clash of lightning and fire, poison gas and rolling earth, biting water and tearing wind. The chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no leader exerts control. Where one element dominates, the will of a mighty force of nature is often what makes it so.{br}The unrestrained chaos is much like a worldly battlefield on which no skilled leader exerts control. In such a combat zone, forces clash without clear direction. The tide of battle is all too often determined merely by fate. Clear advantage on one side or the other can rarely be overcome. One side overwhelms the other by happenstance or because of uneven odds. Victory is won at too heavy a cost.{br}A mythological genasi general of the ancient world, Vyn-kazi, knew the price of warfare&apos;s chaos all too well. She had witnessed it. Like the entropic realm from which they sprang, the great Primordials warred with the gods with no common purpose and no organization - no plan at all. Most of these mighty beings were fractious and grasping loners with armies of fierce slaves. They all but allowed the gods to coordinate against them. One by one, each and its armies succumbed to the gods and their legions.{br}Vyn-kazi survived a disastrous battle in which her master, Nekal of the Glowing Deep, fell against a host that included Pelor, Kord, Bane, Ioun, and Sehanine. The watersoul genasi went on to swear fealty to Pelor and to take on a firesoul aspect in his name. She then led her people against other Primordials in service to the god of the sun, taking the calm blending of two elements in her spirit and what she had witnessed in Nekal&apos;s defeat as models for her command style.{br}Similar to celebrated Vyn-kazi, you have learned to mingle and control the elements that cavort in your body and spirit.

All people, from nobles to peasants, enjoy acrobatics shows, whether amid the finery of court or the debris of the street. A few venturesome religious rites, especially those that pay homage to Avandra or Kord, require the skill. Mastery of the body is part of numerous education philosophies, and acrobatics is unmatched in cultivating fitness and balance. Thieves and burglars use the skill to ply their trade. Training is easy to find and widely accepted. Some youngsters attain a level of mastery well before they reach adolescence.{br}Not to be underestimated is the value of such proficiency on the battlefield. A combatant who is adept at acrobatics can maneuver like no other. The adroit use of the skill opens up advantages that other warriors can&apos;t attain and allows the acrobat to avoid being pinned down. Movement becomes quicker and smoother as the acrobat uses the whole body as a tool, rather than just relying on the feet and the legs. It&apos;s obvious why some martial training includes instruction in acrobatics.{br}It&apos;s also clear that the adventurer has even more use for acrobatics than a warrior or a soldier does. Explorers routinely face perils that are best overcome with agility, poise, and a sense of one&apos;s body. More than one fortune seeker owes life and limb to his dedicated schooling in acrobatics.{br}To say that of you is a gross understatement, however.

Some slay for religion or creed, others for power or influence, and still others for money, vengeance, glory, or just plain relief. Many who have a knack for murder take up violent professions, from soldier or town guard to gladiator or assassin. A few, whatever their reasons, make a career out of slaying monsters.{br}Killing is grim business, no matter who or what ends up dead. Nobody takes going to the grave lightly. Hands-off methods, such as poison, can sometimes work, as can stealthy techniques. Otherwise, direct and bloody conflict is the only way to go about butchery.{br}Strangely, a lot of would-be killers think that combat has rules. You know differently: In battle, fair play, honor, and mercy are for chumps. Fighting is all about dancing with death and being one of those still standing when the music ends. Maybe you came by your &quot;philosophy&quot; while being schooled as an assassin or hired sword. Of course, an adventurer&apos;s life has plenty of object lessons along the same lines: Kill or be killed.{br}When you start a fight, you take a little time to size up the competition. After that, it&apos;s all bloody business. If someone has the nerve to attack you, you make that fool pay in such a way that anyone watching will think twice about facing you. Nobody escapes you unless they have the ability to take you out of the fight, or you want the story of your prowess to get around.{br}However you gained your skills, they are honed in accordance with your brutal creed.

But not all techniques evolve from the teachings of these paragons of the warrior&apos;s art. Some methods come from origins far less noble. The path of the dread reaper is one such shadowy road.{br}According to legend, the first dread reaper was Gulkanon, a human paladin of the Raven Queen, stripped of his station and power for offending his god. Even without the connection to the deity he had long revered, Gulkanon was unwilling to surrender his place as her champion. He turned to a new avenue of military study, building upon the techniques of savage and fell races in the world - orcs, goblins, ogres, and trolls. He took the crude strokes of these brutish creatures and refined them, developing a range of exploits that focused his strength into a vehicle of appalling carnage. As he grew more confident in his newfound skills, he took the title &quot;dread reaper.&quot; He set out to send souls to his estranged patron in hopes of rekindling the bond that had been broken. Whether he succeeded is lost to time, but his legacy remains.{br}Some dread reapers serve the Raven Queen, and small cults of such warriors can be found who are willing to train promising candidates. Others who have this training, however, lack the will or discipline to find true favor with the god. A few stretch her tenets to accommodate their own excesses. The Raven Queen&apos;s vigilant servants have been known to hunt and slay the worst of those offenders.{br}Whether you had an affinity for death-dealing or found inspiration in the actions of another, you turned to the techniques of the dread reaper. The training offers you a special array of fighting maneuvers that emphasize your already impressive proficiency with two-handed weapons. Your training transformed you from a competent warrior to a terrifying force of destruction. Rather than minding your defenses, you favor wreaking havoc in combat.

The deeds and exploits of those conflicts resound still in epic story and song. One such anthem is Lament of the Dreadnought, a somber song that recounts the final march of Jagannash the Unstoppable, a great dragonborn hero.{br}A doughty warrior famed for his ability to fight on no matter the injuries he sustained, Jagannash accumulated a number of legends. He withstood the full fury of an angry blue dragon, shrugged off the lashes of a pit fiend&apos;s whip, and even killed a tiefling warlock who had hurled him through Hell. The Lament, though, speaks of his final battle and all he achieved in the last offensive against the tiefling empire. Jagan nash felled a full legion of devils, strangled their succubus sorceress commander with his bare hands, and hammered his way through the walls of a fortress. He was climbing the tower that housed the tiefling war room when the earth rebelled and swallowed the citadel and all within it. It is whispered that Jagannash fights there still, despite the centuries. Such is his resilience.{br}It is from Jagannash&apos;s example that other fighters who follow a similar creed take inspiration. The mind- body practices of these warriors are kept and taught by a few masters, dragonborn and otherwise. Some even develop these talents without formal training. {br}As a dreadnought, you are an inexorable force of destruction. You turn aside weapons with nothing more than your force of will.

  <thing id="ppFlameCom" name="Flamebrow Commander" description="A dragon driven to wrath is a terrifying foe. It stops at nothing to quench its fury in the blood of those who wronged it. Only the desire to protect its young can drive a dragon to even greater heights of recklessness. A dragonborn warrior is little different, and a dragonborn officer displays parental loyalty to those alongside whom he fights. Such is the dragonborn warrior ideal.{br}An exemplar of this standard was Dhuryan Flamebrow, an audacious but beloved dragonborn mercenary from the fringes of the empire of Arkhosia. Dhuryan was noble born, but upon him fell the consequences of his father&apos;s dark deeds. Without title or property in the empire, and living under the shadow of family history, he made his way as a soldier and leader. He made a habit of leading from the front with a brashness born of being indifferent to death. Glory and the erasing of the past was his overriding aim, yet he was unwilling to sacrifice his fellow fighters for his own gain.{br}Dhuryan succeeded in reshaping the armies of a border province known for its barbarism and monster problems. Eventually, that province and its dragon lord became the most prominent in Arkhosia, although only Dhuryan&apos;s name is widely remembered to this day. At long last, Dhuryan had cleansed his family name. He rose then to prominence as a military advisor and became a general in the wars that eventually destroyed Arkhosia. During this time, he penned the military manifesto titled Flamebrow, in honor of his clan. Myths from many cultures say that Dhuryan fought in numerous wars in this world and beyond, and that he fell but returned to life more than once. Tales say that he stands now beyond the touch of time, alongside other legendary generals, awaiting the world&apos;s need.{br}Flamebrow still exists, copied into many languages. It is a treatise for the commander who wishes to defeat enemies head-on. Although it speaks of deceptive planning and long-term strategies, it also talks of brutal efficiency and courageous leadership when battle is joined.{br}Whether through influence, reading and practice, or direct training, your path has been influenced by Flamebrow. Boldness of action fails to fully describe your methods. You act decisively, willing to lay your own survival on the line to get the job done and protect your allies.{br}{br}FLAMEBROW COMMANDER  PATH FEATURES{b}Flamebrow Revival (11th level){/b}: When you are dying, you add your Charisma modifier to any hit points you regain, and you gain a bonus to death saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier.{br}{b}Relentless Action (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can use your Bravura Presence class feature as if you were your own ally.{br}{b}Roaring Recovery (16th level){/b}: Each time you regain hit points when you are bloodied, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn." compset="Paragon" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ppFlyinAde" name="Flying-Blade Adept" description="Among common folk, knife and shuriken throwing are forms of entertainment and sport. Competitors throw under calm conditions at stationary targets. At the extreme, carnival throwers toss blades at a moving mark, or sport throwers have to put up with rowdy onlookers and too much drink.{br}It takes a special breed of warrior to specialize in throwing blades in actual combat. The clash of steel, the rush of magical forces, and the screams of the wounded and dying are far more than taproom distractions. Moreover, the idea of tossing away a weapon seems tantamount to suicide. Still, anyone who has mastered the technique of hurling blades in battle knows that doing so helps to keep one out of harm&apos;s way.{br}Being such an expert takes guts, discernment, smarts, and quickness. The hurler must be brave enough to throw away a weapon, and to stand fast when the enemy recognizes the danger that he or she presents. The thrower&apos;s senses must be accurate enough to discern when to move and where. Furthermore, perception is nothing without the good judgment to exploit opportunities and to carry the right array of blades. And all this means little if the wielder lacks the agility orspeed to take advantage of whatever battle situation {br}arises.{br}You are such an expert with light thrown blades. Swift enough to draw weapons in rapid succession and to knock an arrow out of the air, you have little to fear when you throw a blade. Your talent allows you to hit with terrifying accuracy, to bounce your blades off one target and into another, and even to punch holes in enemy armor.

Legitimate slayers police the ranks for charlatans, following up on rumors of fake giantslayers.{br}When it comes to being a giantslayer, you are the genuine article.

For the organized and resourceful, there&apos;s always an angle.{br}Thieves&apos; guilds are criminal gangs that crop up mostly in urban areas. A single guild might manage or influence illegal activities such as assassination, blackmail, burglary, espionage, fencing stolen goods, grifting, smuggling, loan sharking, pickpocketing, piracy, racketeering, robbery, thuggery, and so on. A guild might also direct legal enterprises as legitimate business ventures, as cover, or as a way to control the flow of information. For instance, many thieves&apos; guilds have their fingers in begging, bounty hunting, mercenary work, gambling, prostitution, shipping, and even street cleaning and lamp lighting.{br}Because a guild&apos;s business can be so varied, and because it often has trouble with legal authorities and rival gangs, it must divide its profitable interests between various centers of control. Those centers have bosses, who report to those higher in the chain of command. Thus, guilds have complicated hierarchies, clear divisions of authority, and codes of behavior that can border on downright law-abiding in some respects. A guildmaster typically leads a portion of a guild, and some guilds have a grand master who oversees a guild&apos;s entire operation.{br}You might be an actual guildmaster, or maybe you grew up in the criminal world and know what&apos;s what on the street and in a brawl.

As a lower-ranking officer in campaigns of conquest, Malachi proved to be a disciplined and innovative commander, renowned for being able to adapt to any situation. He watched and learned from his enemies, changed tactics at pivotal moments, and regularly used what he knew of his enemies against them. Malachi never knew defeat until he faced forces under the command of Dhuryan Flamebrow of Arkhosia.{br}Stories differ on what happened next. Some say Arkhosia&apos;s leaders put Malachi to death. Others claim that he retired alongside Dhuryan, whom he befriended. A few claim that Malachi now marshals the forces of the Nine Hells.{br}Whatever his fate, Malachi&apos;s brilliance is the root of a tradition of battlefield leadership that has spread across the world.

Not since the fall of Nerath has a coherent force of warriors been guided by honor and justice in all that they do. Bold knights who fought for King Elidyr of Nerath are long lost, and the honor code to which they adhered is a curiosity of history to most. However, some see the need for such nobility today, and they try to live up to the standards set by righteous soldiers long dead. These modern fighters name themselves the knight protectors.{br}Some of those who call themselves knights could equal Nerath&apos;s storied fighters in might and zeal. Without a code, though, who can say with certainty if the new knights can match bygone honor? Without a fellowship, how can like-minded individuals work toward similar ends and police their own? Indeed, a number of those who claim to be knights - and even a few who call themselves knight protectors - are anything but counterparts to the admirable warriors of old. Far too many use their self-claimed title for profligate or brutal gain.{br}A loose confederation of knight protectors acts as an organization for those who claim this path. Its members are pledged to look out for one another and to keep the principles of the order. Courage, industriousness, respect, courtesy, and the glory of battle are all guiding principles. Those who fail to uphold these standards quickly find themselves at odds with other knight protectors.{br}Taking up the sword and cloak of a knight protector, you see it as your task to emulate the knights of old. A warrior and something of a leader, you abide by the knight protector code for personal glory and out of respect for the past. In life, you strive to be noble, honest, and fair. When you and your comrades come under attack, you are at the forefront, testing and displaying your courage. Even if smaller minds mock you as an idealist, you know you fight with dignity and purpose.{br}{br}KNIGHT PROTECTOR  PATH FEATURES{b}Devoted Protector (11th level){/b}: When an enemy marked by you attacks an ally adjacent to you, you can slide the ally 1 square as an immediate interrupt.{br}{b}Protector&apos;s Action (Knight Protector) (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one ally within 5 squares of you gains a +4 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.{br}{b}Knight&apos;s Focus (16th level){/b}: When you can make an attack because of the Combat Challenge class feature or an opportunity attack, you can instead grant adjacent allies a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn as an immediate interrupt." compset="Paragon" uniqueness="unique">

Others, the tratnyr in particular, are multipurpose.{br}Spears are the perfect weapon choice for smallunit commanders who like flexibility. Javelins and other thrown spears enable their wielders to loose volleys at a closing enemy, or make a viable option against a foe that prefers to stay at a distance.

The unseen life energy of plants and animals nearby sings with power as a spell is shaped, a ripe fruit waiting to be plucked and savored. Far too many spellcasters see no reason to resist, and they eagerly rip away the life essence to fuel their magic, but those who choose the preserver&apos;s path carefully shape their spells around this fragile aura, drawing a little energy from many different places, and never so much that the life that it emanates from is harmed or extinguished.{br}In this delicate give-and-take of spellcasting, the master preserver is an arcanist who has developed a perfect sense for the balance of destruction and power. Whereas other casters struggle to maintain their discipline and must consciously control their impulse to drink too deeply of the fragile energy around them, the master preserver&apos;s self-control, experience, and intuitive grasp of the subtle currents at play allow him to instantly shape his spells without fear of defiling. In fact, the master preserver&apos;s skill and precision are so great that he can often match the raw power of the most reckless defilers without harming a single blade of grass.{br}When you choose the master preserver&apos;s path, you turn your back on defiling forever.

  <thing id="ppMercuAss" name="Mercurial Assassin" description="The House of Methys has always had a strong connection to quicksilver. As the story goes, the family fortune was forged from a source of mercury discovered in one of their iron mines, with the wizards and alchemists of the realm paying handsomely for the rare liquid metal. At some point, though, rumors spread that by digging for more mercury, the House of Methys awoke something powerful in the deeps. Then, the rumors abruptly stopped, possibly because anyone heard prying into the details about the noble house died soon after.{br}{br}What most folk don&apos;t know is that a clan of twelve mercury dragons served as the source of the Methys fortune. The merchant house drained them of some of their blood, which can be transformed through ritual magic to pure mercury, and then sold the metal to the highest bidder. At first, these mercury dragons were amused that humans would pay so handsomely for their blood, and their hoards grew at the cost of a minute or two of pain. But when they learned that Methys agents had stolen a clutch of a mercury dragon&apos;s eggs to harvest for the precious liquid metal, they realized the scope of the Methys family&apos;s hunger for power. These twelve mercury dragons, maddened{br}with grief, turned on their business partners and slaughtered the leaders, then used their polymorph ability to assume their identities. Now the Methys dragons have made it their mission to reacquire all of the mercury that came from the dragon eggs by tracking down the sales of the blood using the spotty records the Methys agents kept, plus ensure that knowledge of the ritual used to transform their blood is erased from the world. They have vowed to never again allow another agency to profit from their own blood.{br}{br}To help them in this endeavor, they turned to group of dragonborn agents, gathered one by one. Soon after the original members of House Methys were dispatched, the twelve dragons discovered that by infusing their blood into that of a dragonborn, through a painful ritual colloquially called the Infusion, the dragonborn gained some abilities that benefited them in their pursuit of their masters&apos; goal. The mercurial assassins, as these dragonborn are known, are then sent out to hunt down every drop of mercury created from the foul ritual and bring it back to House Methys. They are also charged with tracking down any copies of the ritual that might exist. Assassinating those individuals who have some portion of the mercury isn&apos;t a primary objective, but it isn&apos;t exactly frowned upon either. The mercurial assassin is rewarded no matter the circumstances.{br}{br}MERCURIAL ASSASSIN  PATH FEATURES{b}Mercurial Agility (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also take a move action.{br}{b}Quicksilver Movement (11th level){/b}: You gain a +1 bonus to speed and a +3 bonus to Stealth checks.{br}{b}Fluid Shape (16th level){/b}: When an enemy makes an opportunity attack against you, the enemy must roll twice and use the lower result." compset="Paragon" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ppPackRun" name="Pack Runner" description="Humanoids have taken clever beasts as companions since the beginning of time. The most prevalent among such  animals are those from the canine family. Like humanoids, canines have a cooperative mentality and an established social order. It&apos;s not surprising that nearly every humanoid race that has the option to do so - from humans to goblins, eladrin to gnolls - keeps hounds or doglike beasts as pets.{br}Myth holds that, just as humanoids have adopted canines, so too have canines adopted humanoids. One such story is the tale of Kurngarl, or Kurn the Hunter. Soon enough after the fall of the tiefling empire that the hatred of that race was still widespread, unnamed human parents bore a tiefling child. The parents left the babe in an enchanted wood to die of exposure. By some twist of destiny - or, certain versions say, by Melora&apos;s fickle mercies - wolves found the infant instead. Yunulf, &quot;the Lady of the Wolves,&quot; added the human child to her litter, naming him Horned Man.{br}Kurngarl developed uncanny skills with nature while living with his wolf family, learning from a variety of other animals as well. Eventually, a dwarf explorer named Fargrim found Kurngarl and took the tiefling child to the ancient dwarven hold of Durigirn. The young tiefling then became a citizen of the dwarven hold and roamed the wilderness surrounding it. Even so, he acknowledged no dwarven name in place of the one his wolf mother had given him. That he translated literally into Dwarven, accepting only the nickname Kurn as an alternative.{br}Kurngarl had many adventures, almost all with his wolf brother Grabor by his side. Kurn and Grabor were renowned as hunters and trackers among the dwarves of Durigirn. They are also mentioned in the legends of other races, enjoying a heroic reputation for battling monsters, especially gnolls and giants. Kurn the Hunter is reputed to have turned the animals of the wilderness against unjust people in civilized areas. As such, he is held as an example by Melora&apos;s followers.{br}Despite differences in your life&apos;s history, like Kurn, you have a preternatural connection with a canine beast. You and your companion function as a deadly unit among the larger pack made up of your other allies. For its part, your companion has taken cues from you, developing a level of competence and guile rivaling that of some humanoids. You have taken the wildness of the wolf into your spirit.

The tenets of justice also require adherents of Bahamut&apos;s faith to oppose injustice and despotism. Although the metallic dragon god is a lover of peace, his laws regularly require battles and crusades.{br}Many valiant folk who serve Bahamut are paladins or clerics. But Bahamut spurns no noble soul&apos;s offer of service. Even those without divine investiture have a place in the effort to bring Bahamut&apos;s light to theworld&apos;s gloomy places. Secular leaders who venerate Bahamut  lend power to the Platinum Dragon&apos;s cause by ensuring order, honor, and justice in worldly institutions.{br}Temples dedicated to honorable battle invariably include Bahamut among the gods respected. Such places teach techniques and values aimed at bringing virtue to the world by example rather than by exhortation. Those sent to learn are often warriors or nobles bound for a nation&apos;s military.{br}Perhaps you came to Bahamut through such schooling. Other good-hearted people find the Platinum Dragon&apos;s ways through personal devotion or study, or even providence. Bahamut willingly instills a small measure of divine grace in those who show true commitment. Your heroic deeds and pure heart have proven you to be worthy of Bahamut&apos;s blessing.

In the hands of a master, its deadliness can be unparalleled.{br}More complex polearms offer even greater rewards on the battlefield and off. They combine the best aspects of spear and blade or axe, allowing the user control and damage unmatched by other weapons. It&apos;s little wonder that whole units of soldiers use polearms in war, and that city watches use these weapons to protect citizens, as well as keep them in line. Because polearms are so common and easily crafted, learning to use one is part of most basic military instruction. Advanced skill isn&apos;t so easy to obtain, but the trials of regular combat serve as well as, if not better than, the training ground. The ability to use a polearm against a variety of foes can seldom be learned through the rigors of soldierly education.{br}Through your adventures, you have mastered the polearm. You prefer a weapon that extends your options and your reach, understanding that it&apos;s better to keep monsters at a distance.

Highest among these is a rrakkma, a vengeance band. In these elite cadres, a mighty few - called rrathmals - gather together and venture forth to hunt those who still watch the free githzerai with covetous eyes. Each rrakkma sets out on a hunt, bringing destruction to mind flayers, githyanki, and other threats wherever they are found.{br}{br}At times, a rrakkma has a specific goal, such as hindering githyanki plans of conquest or ferreting out a hive of mind flayers. Other rrakkmas wander until they have faced a number of foes sufficient to call the mission a success. To serve in a rrakkma is a great privilege, and githzerai preparing to join such a group receive special training. Even a githzerai who has proven worthy while traveling among nongithze-rai might be so honored.{br}{br}You are such a one. You have served your people well, proven yourself worthy of special training, or found a teacher who knows the techniques of the vengeance warriors of the githzerai. Rrathmals have a variety of abilities, but each of them can make assaults decisively, pursue enemies relentlessly, and defeat foes utterly{br}{br}As is always true among the githzerai, what you do with your power is up to you. The expectation is only that you use your rrathmal training to the best of your ability to protect yourself, your people, and your companions. With it, you&apos;ll continue to prove yourself among the greatest of your people. You&apos;ll write yourself into the chronicles of the githzerai and into the nightmares of those who invite your vengeful hand.{br}{br}RRATHMAL  PATH FEATURES{b}Psychic Resistance (11th level){/b}: You gain resist 10 psychic.

One example is the battlefield archer (Player&apos;s Handbook), a tactical shooter that works well in the chaos of small-unit combat.{br}Unlike other archers, the sharpshooter&apos;s purpose is to become legendary for accuracy and skill, as well as for the number and sorts of foes defeated. Quick shooting, accuracy, and deadliness are the sharpshooter&apos;s trademarks, along with the ability to use a bow or a crossbow in ways that few others can.

Only a steadfast ally is better for covering the flank while you&apos;re taking it to the enemy. Nothing is better to protect that ally.{br}Throughout time, the use of the shield has defined military tactics. In phalanx formations, common among many folk, one soldier stands alongside another, each relying on a comrade&apos;s shield for added protection. During a charge, a shield aids in pushing the enemy back or even down. Warriors in a unit of skilled shield bearers can place their shields together in an overarching arrangement, completely protecting all within the shield shell from outside attack. This is said to have originally been a dwarven trick, a &quot;boulder formation.&quot;{br}The Arkhosian warrior-philosopher Khomagar said, &quot;The shield is the law of the battlefield, protecting the soldier as lordly and righteous edicts protect the empire.&quot; Phalanx fighters from many cultures suffer dishonor or worse for losing their shields in battle, since such a loss weakens the unit as a whole. Numerous peoples maintain a tradition of bringing dead warriors home on their shields, and burying a shield with its owner. Especially among dwarves, a broken shield is seen as a symbol of loss or corruption.{br}The shield is even more important to a small-unit fighter who relies upon it to protect his or her few allies. To the wise soldier who fulfills such duties, a shield is as much a weapon as a defensive item.{br}You know these facts well.

  <thing id="ppShockTro" name="Shock Trooper" description="Nerath was a just nation, it is said, but it would be a lie to say that it was built solely through negotiation, the  spread of knowledge, and cultural influence. No, as any historian can tell you, Nerath rose on the splintered shields and shattered blades of its soldiers. When an object of conquest doesn&apos;t bend, it must be made to bow.{br}That was the job of Nerath&apos;s legions. Those armies consisted primarily of highly trained heavy infantry supplemented by heavy cavalry - the famed knight protectors. Nerath&apos;s military traditions were derived from older sources. In what any dragonborn would claim to be fine dragonborn style, a special auxiliary force of devastating light infantry led many of Nerath&apos;s assaults. These were the empire&apos;s shock troopers. Military historians liken them to similar troops among other cultures and peoples, especially elves and dragonborn.{br}The typical shock trooper wore chainmail over leather, and carried a longsword and short sword, or dual short swords. The trooper was trained to break the line of an enemy force, moving quickly to kill and wound as many enemy soldiers as possible. If a trooper broke through the enemy line, the job then became direct assault on enemy command positions.{br}Although Nerath no longer exists as an empire, more than a few of its traditions linger. Numerous fighters and schools of soldiery carry on shock trooper traditions. This is to say nothing of the similar soldiers among other peoples, such as dwarf assault fighters. Any warrior who wants training in this brutal and mobile assault style can readily find it.{br}You are part of this sudden strike tradition of fighting. Unlike those warriors who form battle lines, you move among your enemies, defying them to strike you down and forcing them to pursue you. Your daring onslaughts confuse and astonish your adversaries. Even so, your guard is never down, especially in your favorite place: the center of a throng of foes.{br}{br}SHOCK TROOPER  PATH FEATURES{b}Deadly Soldier (11th level){/b}: When you wield an off-hand weapon, increase the weapon&apos;s damage die by one size.{br}{b}Footwork Action (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex until the end of your next turn.

These wars culminated in what came to be known as the Last Battle of the Spiral Tower.

Drow and demons had taken the mythic site during a protracted battle that saw the eladrin fighting on many fronts.

In the end, Ossandrya&apos;s efforts proved successful. Although the Spiral Tower was reduced to a blackened spindle bereft of magic, the eladrin drove the drow out for good.{br}In time, the Spiral Tower was rebuilt.

They use a variety of methods to acquire this enlightenment. Among these is a cycle of quieting the mind and then returning to physical activity. {br}{br}A major aspect of the process is meditation. When the mind is allowed to naturally become still in meditation, it transcends normal mental boundaries and leaves the ego behind for blissful silence. Githzerai refer to tapping this transcendent silence as &quot;knowing oneself.&quot; To them, this is like allowing a field to remain fallow for a season, allowing it to retain and build up the nutrients it would otherwise give away. {br}{br}Returning to physical responsibilities and focused training plants seeds in the healthier soil. The body grows more in tune with the mind and the soul. Because it is nurtured in all aspects, the whole organism grows stronger. {br}Work and rest in such cycles bears fruit for the devotee in greater skill, greater peace of mind, and greater accord with the outer world. It is this connection of inner self and outer world that storvakals attempt to master. The storvakal has reached a milestone of personal development such that he or she can command nearby forces and expect a positive response. The storvakal&apos;s personal being also responds to adversity more like water flowing around a hammer than a stone struck by the same instrument. Githzerai refer to this state of being as &quot;support of nature,&quot; which garners any githzerai who has it great respect. {br}{br}Such harmony and respect is yours, for your dedication has placed you on the path of the storvakal. Your serenity mixes with your formidable powers to defend you and give you focus, as well as to support your allies. Adversaries mistake your lack of histrionics for weakness at their peril. Your calm is that of the alpine lake, deep and inscrutable. Their own emotions and lack of commitment give you inroads to manipulate and defeat them.{br}{br}From now on, the world around you will reorder itself to your needs in ways small and great. Minor fortunate events that seem like luck to others will prove your inner and outer accord. The limit to this support of nature is yours to determine with your dedication and deeds. As it grows, so shall your ability to accomplish anything toward which you bend your will.{br}{br}STORVAKAL  PATH FEATURES{b}Rebalanced Mind (11th level){/b}: Reduce the total penalty you are taking to your attack rolls, skill checks, or ability checks by 2.{br}{b}Restoring Action (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can roll a saving throw against each effect on you that a save can end.{br}{b}Mind Bar (16th level){/b}: You gain a +2 bonus to all defenses against charm, fear, and psychic attacks." compset="Paragon" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ppSylvaArc" name="Sylvan Archer" description="Like their eladrin cousins, elves have the time and the will to give everything they do a complex expression. To them, something worth doing at all is worth doing better than well - it&apos;s worth total dedication of body, mind, and soul. Any task merits mastering to the extent that the very process of doing it, even in training, is beautiful. Further, to the fey mind, combining seemingly disparate arts and joys into one form creates something more beautiful in the end. This is as true of archery as it is of any other activity.{br}Ages ago, after they entered the world and became separated from the eladrin, elves found it necessary to survive in the hostile wilds. Grace and awareness became their strengths. The bow became their chosen weapon for hunting and stealthy warfare.{br}The magic flowing in the fey soul has enabled more than one elf to forge a spiritual tie with the bow. Such archers are practiced at engaging targets in dense forests and areas fraught with cover. The sound of an enemy bowstring being drawn or the hint of movement in the undergrowth is enough to draw a reactive shot faster than any intended attack can come. A master of elven archery easily deals with multiple foes, and in time develops the uncanny ability to make arrows literally track their targets. Elven arrows can be said literally to have an enemy&apos;s name on them.{br}You carry on this glorious tradition. Stalking in untamed and dangerous places armed with only quiver and bow, you have become an exemplar of elven marksmanship. Your finely honed senses are second to none, and your aim is ever true. Among the most formidable of hunters, you have a shooting expertise that transcends the mundane skill of other archers. Your spirit reaches out to inform you of the unseen. If your skill and your amazing deeds carry you farther, elves who come to the way of the bow after you will hold you as the example that guides them.{br}{br}SYLVAN ARCHER  PATH FEATURES{b}Archer&apos;s Action (Sylvan Archer) (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, your ranged attack rolls take no penalties for cover, superior cover, concealment, or total concealment until the end of your next turn.{br}{b}Sylvan Senses (11th level){/b}: You gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks.{br}{b}Intuitive Hunter (16th level){/b}: When making ranged attacks, you add your Wisdom modifier to the extra damage dealt by your Hunter&apos;s Quarry class feature." compset="Paragon" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ppTieflHel" name="Tiefling Hellstalker" description="Supernatural might comes naturally to a tiefling. Blood tied to the dark history of devils makes the reason for this obvious. In a vestigial form, this power lends vehemence to a tiefling&apos;s retaliation against attackers. History has shown that a tiefling who wishes to do so can reach inward for even more power, manifesting it in a variety of ways.{br}Those ways are mirrored in devils and their home. When mortals speak of the Nine Hells, they refer to fire, smoke, and the burning wrath of fiends. But the truth is more complex. The hells have ice, storms, and shadow. They even have combinations of these, the elements mixing in strange and unnatural ways to produce oddities such as lightless fire.{br}Some tieflings prefer to live up to expectations, displaying talent with anger and flame. They evoke terror by playing the devil&apos;s part. But they lack subtlet y, which is a devil&apos;s best tool. They fail to acknowledge that mortals most fear what they can&apos;t see.{br}Drawing on the darkness within, a darkness that extends from the hells, a tiefling can gain uncanny advantages against enemies. Eyes can be dimmed, darkness and invisibility can be pierced, and flesh can be burned without light.{br}You know this, because you have learned to summon the darkness enshrouding your soul. By coupling it with your deadly martial skills, you become a terror in lightless halls under the earth, as well as on shadowed streets and in moonless wilds. Where light does find you, you snuff it in the sight of your foes.

In its most basic form, this infernal might allows the tiefling to channel anger and a desire for vengeance into attacks more vehement than normal. In ages past, however, tiefling warriors learned to channel their negative emotions into tools for war.{br}Fallen Bael Turath had whole cadres of mighty fighters who could funnel fiendish fury into their military maneuvers. Despite the loss of the empire, some of these devilish fighters survived. Their fighting customs were passed on, lasting through the centuries. Today, a few tiefling soldiers offer training that allows would-be warfiends to control the devil inside. Others, who must do without such guidance, find that the inner fiend is best directed into violence lest it pollute other aspects of life.{br}So many of your kind fear the taint lurking in their soul, but you realize it is merely a tool at your disposal.

Although humans and elves cherish this  celebrated figure, many other peoples speak of him with reverence. Tales differ about his actual heritage, human or half-elf. It is known that he was born to common folk outside elf lands in a kingdom that would one day be part of the empire of Nerath.{br}Jarret&apos;s natural charm won him friends above his station, including young nobles with little or no chance of inheritance. As a result, Jarret gained martial training and took to forming groups of do-gooders and fortune seekers. His ability to lead these small bands to success against all odds came to be well documented. He and his comrades traveled widely and are credited with making life safer in many places. Jarret&apos;s companions seldom left the adventuring life for any reason other than significant wealth; certainly death was not the primary reason.{br}Jarret wasn&apos;t so lucky. He fell in battle against the mind flayers of Thoon deep within the Underdark. No magic could bring him back.{br}The story doesn&apos;t end there, however. Many believe Jarret was reborn as a lad of the same name who grew up in nearly the same place. This perhaps-reincarnated Jarret became an inspiring leader and hero like his namesake. He performed similar deeds, and never refuted claims that he was the same Jarret. Instead, he used the rumor to his advantage, renewing former ties of friendship and striking fear into old enemies. He became known for taking special interest in opposing aberrant creatures, such as mind flayers. Those who knew and loved him eventually dubbed him Jarret the Twiceborn. Yarns say he lives still in the heavens, alongside great generals from times past.{br}Jarret&apos;s accomplishments and methods are recorded in story, history, and song. From these, many venturesome souls draw inspiration and try to duplicate Jarret&apos;s feats. Some successful imitators even claim to teach his methods.{br}Maybe your natural talents led you on a road similar to Jarret&apos;s. You&apos;ve taken what you could from folktales and, perhaps, teachers. In your travails, you carry on Jarret&apos;s folk-hero tradition.

Such elves champion nature in all its forms, placing the needs of the wilderness above their own. These heroes are called twilight guardians, for they preserve the wilderness from the encroaching darkness, safeguarding the natural world from destruction at the hands of the incautious and the malevolent alike.{br}Though it might seem that the twilight guardian chooses to champion the cause of nature, most twilight guardians would say that the world chose them. The world responds, they believe, to an uncommon reverence for nature, an awareness of the true power of life, and an understanding of the need for a harmonious balance to ensure the world&apos;s survival. These qualities arise most commonly among the elves, and thus the path of the twilight guardian is unique to that race.{br}As a twilight guardian, you evolve into a physical conduit of natural power, channeling the life force of the earth itself to better combat your enemies. The power flowing though you sharpens your senses and attunes you to your surroundings. Protecting the wilderness is your paramount concern. You are not required to safeguard a particular region, but instead to protect nature wherever you go in your travels.

An ordinary minstrel, a graceful dancer, or a honey-voiced singer might well be a killer sent by a bitter rival. Custom demands, however, that no entertainer be refused entry. The household should welcome such a guest regardless of any suspicions. Nevertheless, paranoid nobles might turn away one of these entertainers for fear of poison in their drink or a knife in their back.{br}Those who refuse entry to a performer do so at risk to themselves. Even if the new arrival did not have malicious intent, a refusal is an insult few performers can bear, and such an affront makes enemies where there were none before.{br}An unwelcome guest is a talented entertainer who uses his or her performer&apos;s status to infiltrate a target&apos;s house and get close enough to make the kill. Unwelcome guests master the use of poisons, hiding venoms and toxins about their persons for easy access when the opportunity to kill presents itself. Some unwelcome guests work alone, but many claim membership in an entertainer&apos;s troupe, an organization often rife with murderers, thieves, and saboteurs. Bards make the best unwelcome guests, but rogues, fighters, and assassins might find something in this path for themselves as well.{br}{br}UNWELCOME GUEST  PATH FEATURES{b}Condemning Action (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to make an attack, each target you hit with that attack is immobilized and grants combat advantage until the end of your next turn.{br}{b}Duplicitous Nature (11th level){/b}: You gain the Alchemist feat as a bonus feat.

You can hide them on your person and retrieve them with ease. A dagger&apos;s short blade allows you to be close enough to your prey to explain why it has to die.

  <thing id="ppWhiteHor" name="White Horn Knight" description="Eachthighern (pronounced &quot;Whitehorn&quot;), the Lord of Unicorns, is one of the most respected archfey in the Court of Stars. His wisdom is valued and respected by Queen Tiandra, and rival archfey such as Baba Yaga begrudgingly acknowledge his strength. Unlike most other archfey, Eachthighern takes mortal heroes as his personal knights and sends them forth to stamp out evil creatures wherever they are found.{br}When Eachthighern needs a new knight, he sends a herald to one of his choices. These heralds are usually eladrin bards, but sometimes he assigns this duty to more exotic fey such as centaurs or unicorns. The herald transports the prospective knight to the Serene Glade, where Eachthighern makes his offer. If the person refuses the offer, Eachthighern is saddened but respects the candidate&apos;s wishes. The herald then takes the person back, but this former candidate loses the memories of the audience thanks to the use of a special type of oblivion moss. If the candidate accepts the offer, the Lord of Unicorns touches the person with his horn, in a manner similar to a king knighting a squire. If the newly accepted knight desires it, he or she receives Eachthighern&apos;s heraldic symbol of a unicorn rampant in a field of deep blue, but such displays aren&apos;t mandatory because Feywild natives instinctively recognize Lord Eachthighern&apos;s mark upon the knight.{br}A White Horn knight&apos;s quests include anything from rescuing slaves from fomorian holds to guiding travelers safely through dangerous woodlands plagued by mad dryads, sly verbeeg, or ferocious owlbears. The knights count evil fey such as lamias and hags as their greatest opponents, because these creatures often hunt unicorns for their hearts and horns, which such dark fey use in their horrid rituals.{br}A White Horn knight is blessed with some of the Lord of Unicorns&apos; power and gains the service of a loyal unicorn steed. The knight&apos;s abilities mark the character as a valiant leader in the fight against evil. Though most White Horn knights pay ultimate homage to their lord, some also serve Corellon.{br}{br}WHITE HORN KNIGHT  PATH FEATURES{b}Unicorn&apos;s Action (11th level){/b}: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you or an ally adjacent to you regains hit points equal to 5 + your Strength or Charisma modifier.{br}{b}Unicorn&apos;s Advance (11th level){/b}: You ignore difficult terrain while charging.
